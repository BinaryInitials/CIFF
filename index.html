THE STORY OF CREEM MAGAZINE chronicles what some consider to be the greatest rock  n  roll magazine ever made (with an iconic mascot designed by cartoonist, Robert Crumb). In this compelling film, Alice Cooper, Cameron Crowe, Michael Stipe, Chad Smith, Joan Jett, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Kirk Hammett, and Wayne Kramer express their love and appreciation for Creem. Started in Detroit in 1969 by Barry Kramer, the magazine aimed to be the anti-Rolling Stone. Instead of covering artists in New York and Los Angeles, Creem was devoted to the sounds of the Midwest, particularly the booming scene in its hometown. They were the first to feature such bands as The MC5, The Stooges, and Parliament Funkadelic. But they weren t just known for their work; the motley crew of a staff lived the rockstar lifestyle themselves, with their headquarters being a destination for debauchery. As their popularity rose, internal problems emerged between Kramer and notorious editor, Lester Bangs, causing chaos behind the scenes. Sadly, both died of drug overdoses in the early 80s. Director Scott Crawford uncovers the ups and downs of one of music s biggest influencers in this entertaining rockumentary.  E.F.<br>Director: Scott Crawford, who has spent much of his life documenting indie culture, launched Harp Magazine in 2001. His critically acclaimed debut documentary, "Salad Days," won multiple festival awards.</p></div></a>

She is a beautiful young woman who is passionate about the chateau s history; most notably about the story of a famous book that was set on the property, written by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle. Known as the  Father of Popular Science,  Fontenelle was a philosopher, scientist, and writer who made complex scientific ideas easier to understand for the common man. His book, Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds, revolves around a philosopher and an aristocratic woman who spend a week walking around the chateau, talking about philosophy and science. Sound familiar? As the film progresses, scenes begin to loop and overlap, creating a complex and captivating reality. Imaginative and engaging, AROUND THE SUN is a beautiful portrait of two people caught in the perplexing world of time and space.

And neither can stand to look at her. To take his mind off his wife s infidelity, Greg turns to his career as a detective, as their town is in a panic after a recent rash of kidnappings that eerily resembles the work of a man who terrorized the community a decade ago. Meanwhile, Jackie begins to notice strange things happening at home. Her family thinks she s crazy until they start witnessing the hair-raising occurrences for themselves. There s some kind of dark presence toying with them, and it s becoming increasingly more hostile. In order to solve this bizarre mystery, they ll need to look at things from an entirely different perspective. I SEE YOU begins as a thriller but skillfully morphs into a brilliant blend of numerous genres. When it comes to edge-of-your-seat plot-twisters like this, it s clich  to say you ll never see the ending coming. But for this walloping mind-bender, it s undeniably apt.  E.F.<br>Director: London native, Adam Randall, wrote and directed several award-winning shorts before moving to features in 2015. Randall is represented by CAA/Management 360/Casarotto.</p></div></a>

You also need a good venue, enthusiastic fans, a first-class sound system, and some eye-popping lighting. Concert promoters the people who make this all happen are the stars of this rock-doc. Before giant corporations gobbled up the touring industry, there was a group of passionate individuals who built it up from scratch. In rock s early days, the idea that fans would want to see a band play for hours was unheard of. The concert evolution is skillfully chronicled here, paying homage to such pioneers as Frank Barsalona, who created the modern touring network, and the regional players who kept it rolling from Bill Graham in San Francisco, all the way to the Belkins in Cleveland. The film also features interviews with artists including Carlos Santana and Jon Bon Jovi, who recall the promoters who impacted their careers. THE SHOW S THE THING: THE LEGENDARY PROMOTERS OF ROCK is upbeat and engrossing a fun documentary about rock  n  roll s unsung heroes.

Things don t get clearer as the movie continues. Twenty-something Dolkar, an esthetician living in modern-day Delhi, shadows a mysterious Tibetan refugee, who keeps dialing a disconnected phone number. But through a combination of flashbacks and a contemporary narrative, the plot starts falling into place. Dolkar is also Tibetan, and she was the little girl caught in the gunfire, as her parents risked a harrowing Himalayan journey to give her a better life in India. The man she s currently following is actually someone she encountered on that trip, which dredges up distressing memories. Actress Tenzin Dolker portrays Dolkar with nuance and grace, especially as these upsetting revelations accumulate and inflict more emotional anguish. But while THE SWEET REQUIEM illustrates how difficult it is to escape from the past, the film also underscores how cathartic it can be to embrace pain and transform it into forgiveness.

Picture dog fur dyed with every color under the sun and then transformed into mermaids, dinosaurs, Disney characters, and Johnny Depp s face. It s really something you have to see to believe. To creative groomers, dogs are not just companions, but works of art  expensive and all-consuming works of art. The time and money spent on these projects make creative grooming not just a hobby, but a lifestyle. WELL GROOMED is a documentary that follows four creative groomers through their triumphs and challenges on their journeys to the world s largest grooming competition in Hershey, Pennsylvania. While at first you might be drawn to this movie out of sheer curiosity, by the end you will find yourself emotionally invested and rooting for your favorite underdog (no pun intended) to win first place.

Not long after, she began to experiment with more unconventional songs, exploring artistic norms and boundaries. But instead of receiving continued success, she was quickly dropped from her record label. Twelve years after reaching number one on the UK charts, Kate Nash is out to reclaim and reinvent herself as an artist. With courage and vulnerability, she grapples with the changing world of music. The cut-throat industry has always been grueling, but with the streaming services and social media of today, making it as an artist has become even more difficult  especially when your manager is caught stealing all of your money. Ripe with failures, fears, and frustrations, KATE NASH: UNDERESTIMATE THE GIRL is not just a portrait documentary, but also an unflinching and personal look into the costs of fame and the exhaustive process of keeping it.

Grief-stricken and feeling isolated, he leaves the Egyptian leper colony where he s lived for decades in search of his biological family. The trip is arduous: not only do his scarred face and hands draw mockery and discrimination, but he encounters robbers, extreme poverty, and near-starvation along the way. Beshay s saving grace is his traveling companion, a spirited orphan boy named Obama, whose indefatigable spirit and resiliency buoy the pair despite their obstacles. The two travelers form an unshakable bond that eventually helps them discover the true meaning of home and unconditional love even if neither is exactly what they expected. While Beshay s loneliness can be wrenching, YOMEDDINE ultimately ends up as a meditation on acceptance and tolerance, and the ways even small kindnesses matter to people trying to find their emotional and physical equilibrium.

Thankfully, the city also has an abundance of generous people who want to give these furry creatures better (and safer) lives. Although THE CAT RESCUERS features plenty of adorable kitties, the documentary s real stars are the kind-hearted souls who make personal sacrifices to save these animals. Fierce and protective Sassee dedicates much of her free time to looking after vulnerable cats. Mild-mannered Stu (dubbed  Superman to the cats  by one neighbor) rises before dawn to feed Brooklyn strays before heading to his day job. And sensitive activist Claire, the co-founder of nonprofit Brooklyn Animal Action, has devoted nine years of her life to rescues. Yet the beauty of THE CAT RESCUERS is how much the felines also help their saviors. Ambitious Tara, for example, fosters and cares for cats because they helped her survive personal trauma, addiction, and maybe even loneliness. Give this film a loud purr and two paws up.

Its popularity grew, and in the 1960s charismatic professional golfers such as Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer expanded its audience. Today, Tiger Woods and other players are full-blown celebrities. But what about the mysterious people carrying their bags around the golf course? In LOOPERS: THE CADDIE S LONG WALK, director Jason Baffa shifts the spotlight to these individuals. At one time, the prevailing expectation for caddies was this: show up, keep up, and shut up. However, this inspiring documentary paints a different picture of these essential, unsung heroes, who often act as advisors, counselors, and confidants. The job has become so vital to victory there are training programs to teach these skills. The film highlights one at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, led by renowned caddie master, Mike Kiely.

Eliana wants to return to Mexico, but Tina needs to stay in the States so that she can safely transition a difficult journey for anyone, but especially true for Tina given her circumstances. Along with undocumented status, Tina faces issues of discrimination and harassment from an unsympathetic world. Without a Green Card and insurance, the medical bills are piling up. Then Jason, Tina s uncertain lover, withdraws as the transition nears. Even Tina is having doubts, especially when a beloved transgender activist is killed by police. THE GARDEN LEFT BEHIND informs us about the range of issues facing transgender people during the process. It is the gripping story of a woman-in-progress whom we grow to love, and whose success and safety we both root and fear for.

In the 1990s, 90% of hog farms disappeared in the U.S., succumbing to buyouts from American-made Smithfield Foods, whose industrialized factory systems replaced the family farmer. When Smithfield was acquired by WH Group of China, the ripple effects were felt worldwide. SOYALISM starts locally in North Carolina, where acres of lagoons full of hog waste threaten the community's coastal water sources. South of the border, soybean plantations in Brazil replace family farms-and swaths of the Amazon Rainforest-to provide feed for the growing number of livestock. Across the ocean, even Mozambique, whose tropical climate is less-than-ideal for farming soybeans, joins the charge to fuel China's growing consumption of meat products. An eye-opening documentary exposing the shocking global impacts of agribusiness and overpopulation, SOYALISM illustrates the detriment to local residents, communities, and our environment when corporate greed sits at the top of the food chain.

Seemingly, against all reason, those who swore oaths to save lives are taking their own at a rate double that of the general public. There are startling reasons for this, involving a culture of abuse where expectations for students and practitioners are crippling, while support and help are nearly nonexistent. Our healthcare system seems reluctant to acknowledge the crisis, even attempting cover-ups. Sleep-deprivation, drug abuse, and profound depression endanger caregivers  lives and the lives of those they care for. DO NO HARM is a battle cry from the families and co-workers of doctors and medical students who killed themselves. It is both terrifying and hopeful. You will meet physicians who are fighting to address the crisis, along with the system s defenders who see no problems or need to change. All of us, at some time, will need a doctor. DO NO HARM will start long overdue conversations about helping the people we turn to when we need help the most.

Founded in 1958 by sociologist/real estate developer, Nat Mendelsohn, it was supposed to become the next big metropolis. The land is located in the Mojave Desert, 108 miles north of Los Angeles, a place Mendelsohn hoped his city would one day rival. But reality has a way of impacting dreams. Today it sits severely underdeveloped, looking like a ghost town with a population of just 14,000. While that s five times what it was in 1984, it s still a tiny amount of people in such a huge space. Filmmaker Fabrizio Maltese documents life in this nearly empty, unfinished wasteland in his fascinating sociological documentary, CALIFORNIA DREAMING. The film follows numerous California City citizens, including a hopeful businessman who started a company there, an embattled mayor, a vibrant drag queen restaurant owner/political candidate, and several others whose lives have been forever changed by the peculiar place they call home. Maltese s beautifully shot film is an exploration of the American dream and its unfulfilled promises.

Being an immigrant from humble roots himself, he used the success of his newspaper, The World, to give voice to the voiceless and to empower the disenfranchised. With his passion for democratic ideals, Pulitzer fought for the free press and essentially created the news as we know it today. The entire concept of reading the newspaper as a morning ritual was invented by Joseph Pulitzer. Though his list of accomplishments seems unending, Pulitzer was a complicated and imperfect man, known for his sharp temper, poor health, and long list of enemies and rivals. This film is narrated by Adam Driver and features Liev Schreiber as Joseph Pulitzer in re-enactments. With stories told by a variety of historians and experts, JOSEPH PULITZER: VOICE OF THE PEOPLE is a fascinating look into the life, accomplishments, and legacy of the man behind the Pulitzer Prize.  G.S.<br>Director: Oren Rudavsky is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. His film, A Life Apart: Hasidism in America, was short-listed for the Academy Awards, and his film, Hiding and Seeking: Faith and Tolerance After the Holocaust, was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award.

Leonard Soloway is bringing a show to Broadway. Admit it. You just thought,  Who is that?  We are glad you asked. So is he. Leonard Soloway is an authentic Broadway legend whose career includes over 100 shows, 62 Tony nominations, 40 Tony Awards, and 21 Drama Desk Awards. And he has worked with some of the greatest stars of the stage along the way. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Soloway started his career at the Cleveland Play House.

Outspoken, humorous, and openly gay long before it was acceptable, Soloway became a force in the Broadway world with his dedication and boundless energy. LEONARD SOLOWAY S BROADWAY is a warm and friendly documentary that (wisely) stands aside and lets this disarming gentleman tell his own story in his own way. Soloway is an elegant raconteur, so prepare for razzle-dazzle and backstage gossip delivered with enough charm to power a thousand opening nights.

With the addition of their third sibling, Bruno, the brothers handle their sweet, gracious grandmother s every need from mealtime and bath time, to reluctant physical therapy sessions in the public park. Their love for Am rica is undeniable, but the months of intensive care grow more difficult for the grandsons, especially because they are obligated to keep their own ambitions on hold.

When Jill s other child turns into a dog after falling into their pool, she wants the baby back, but Lisa refuses. And just who is the killer of the local yoga teacher stalking them? Welcome to the brace-wearing, golf-cart driving, pastel insanity of a suburbia that could only exist in a subdivision of hell. How black is the outrageous humor of GREENER GRASS? Close your eyes and plunge your head into a bottle of ink. Eschewing all decorum and boundaries, this insanely funny satire shreds marriage, children, school, television, family photos, and pretty much everything else America holds sacred. Played with deadpan brilliance by an awesome cast, GREENER GRASS grows more inappropriate, unhinged, and surreal by the frame. Assuming the mantle of John Waters, these filmmakers invert decency so often that laughing is all you can do. Most subversively, the more deliciously deranged the film becomes, the more uncomfortably familiar it seems. Prepare to howl with laughter, moral core notwithstanding.

As a child of the Civil Rights Movement, Sellers stands for the same ideals his father did, and he uses his family s history as inspiration to campaign for change. WHILE I BREATHE, I HOPE follows this young black democratic candidate on his race for lieutenant governor of South Carolina.

However, the sport at the heart of FLOAT isn t exactly pro, nor is it well-known. This intriguing documentary, with its stunning cinematography, chronicles the small but dedicated scene of competitive model aviation. While the modern world is obsessed with attention and speed, these devoted, unknown challengers like to take things slow. Patience is their true talent, coupled with unwavering passion. After all, they don t make a dime competing, but instead deplete their savings to buy supplies. Call it obsession, but there s something refreshing about their thankless allegiance to the sport. They spend countless hours designing and constructing their complex planes (F1Ds, to be more technical), which could easily pass for art. The detailing is as remarkable as their impressive ability to stay airborne for long periods of time. To see them all soaring at once is truly a sight to behold. At first glance, FLOAT may seem like a niche documentary for model plane enthusiasts. But everyone can learn from the graceful simplicity, loyal camaraderie, and undying devotion these competitors exhibit.

While the numbers are staggering, these victims are anything but statistics. A GIRL NAMED C, a documentary illustrating the life-altering rape of an 11-year-old, forces the uncomfortable topic of child sexual assault into the limelight. The unforgettable events C kept secret in her suburban New Jersey home sparked a change her parents noticed instantly. Their once joyful, caring daughter had become sullen, angry, and closed off. With no inkling of such a thing as rape nor any support from the school after their daughter s mysterious transformation, the family relocates to Colorado for a fresh start. It isn t until C feels some distance she is able to face her horror and allow the painful healing to begin. With an almost whimsical overlay of C s actual drawings and self-portraits, the film marries a childlike artistry with the heart-wrenching toll of assault on a child and her entire family.

In the early 20th century, the region was home to more automotive manufacturing than any place in the world outside of Detroit. But globalization and automation have since had a significant impact on families and their access to good-paying work. Acclaimed Ohio filmmakers, Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert, had cameras rolling as 2,400 people lost their jobs amidst the 2008 closure of the General Motors Moraine Assembly Plant. The result was the Academy Award -nominated film,  The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant  (CIFF34). Bognar and Reichert returned to the factory site large enough to hold 41 football fields as a Chinese billionaire opened a glassmaking factory there in 2015 and moved a large team of employees to Ohio. Three years of unbelievable access to the factory lines and meetings with the 2,000 employees captured the early days of exhilaration that soon gave way to language and cultural barriers, conflict, and a union organizing campaign. AMERICAN FACTORY offers an all-access experience to factory floors and the Dayton-area homes of workers on both sides of the divide.  Patrick Shepherd<br>Director: Steven Bognar is an independent filmmaker and media arts educator. Julia Reichert is a three-time Oscar nominee, co-founder of New Day Films and Professor Emeritus of Motion Pictures at Wright State University in Ohio. Residents of Yellow Springs, Ohio, the couple won the U.S. Documentary Directing Award at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.</p></div></a>

Her indelible performances in such films as  Moonstruck  and  Steel Magnolias  have become landmarks on the cultural map. Not every star, as we know, is a work of art off-stage or off-screen as well. Many don t wish to be known outside their craft. Some are shy. Welcome to OLYMPIA. This wonderful bear-hug of a documentary is an all-access pass to one of the most disarmingly honest and genuine performers alive. Open and generous, Olympia Dukakis shares her life and opinions, raw and unfiltered. From her early days unable to get roles because she was too  ethnic,  to her founding of the beloved Whole Theater Company, this is the journey of an artist whose amazing marriage and career are acts of fearless exploration and passion. Time in her company is a true joy. If you are not already a fan, you will be after this.

But the foursome wore it like a badge of honor. Fronted by singer/multi-instrumentalist Tim Taylor, the indie rock outfit was ahead of its time musically, lyrically, and sonically. Taylor came from a jazz background and, as those in the film affirm, he could play anything. While their songs maintained a level of pop sensibility, their quirky frontman s penchant for experimentation made them wholly unique. After touring with The Jesus Lizard, Girls Against Boys, and Beck, they found themselves at the center of a major label bidding war. But a week before signing a contract, Taylor died in a tragic car accident. BRAINIAC: TRANSMISSIONS AFTER ZERO highlights the incredible impact Taylor and his bandmates had on the world of alternative music. It features ardent interviews with members of such bands as Nine Inch Nails, Melvins, Mars Volta, The National, and Hole, all of whom were greatly inspired by Brainiac. Though their time together was unfortunately brief, this absorbing documentary helps to ensure Brainiac s ingenious music will live on.  E.F.<br>Director: Eric Mahoney is a Brooklyn, New York-based director, producer, and musician. His debut documentary, North Dixie Drive, premiered at the NYC New Filmmakers Festival and was called, "a perfect cinematic piece of cultural anthropology," by director Jim Jarmusch.</p></div></a>

The jazz icon s career went through many transformations from his early days with bebop to later experiments fusing jazz with rock, funk, and early electronic music. His life beyond the trumpet, which Nelson often focuses on, followed a similarly varied path. Unlike most African-Americans in the 1920s, Davis grew up wealthy, although it didn t prevent him from experiencing the cruel scourge of racism. The film describes his famous trip to Paris, where he was elated to be treated as an intellectual equal. He was so depressed about returning to the racially tumultuous United States, it spawned a heroin addiction. His love life was complicated, too, as Davis admitted music came before everything and everyone in his life. Keeping balance, the film examines his darker side, including his brushes with domestic abuse. Nelson offers something for everyone here: die-hards will enjoy the never-before-seen photos and footage, while casual fans and newbies will get a crash course on everything Miles Davis.  E.F.<br>Director: Stanley Nelson is an American documentary filmmaker and a MacArthur genius fellow. He is known as a director, writer, and producer of documentaries examining African American history and experiences. Nelson is a recipient of the 2013 National Humanities Medal from President Obama. He has won three Primetime Emmy Awards.</p></div></a>

A former local, Goddard knew the city revered its high school football team, and her intuition suspected this story was bigger than the local news was reporting. After some in-depth social media sleuthing, Goddard untangled and published an elaborate web of time-stamped conversations, photos, and videos relating to the rape of a 16-year-old girl, flinging the story into the international spotlight. Immaculately polished and profoundly unsettling, ROLL RED ROLL documents the details of the incident as it unfolded and inevitably divided a city into victim blamers and individuals in support of the case s Jane Doe. The film s video footage of police interviews and conversations with Goddard, lead investigator Detective J.P. Rigaud, students, families, and local residents reveals the deep-seated differences society holds in regards to rape culture and to what lengths we will go to protect some at the expense of others.

This time around, they are pointing the camera at factory farming and the toll it s had on our country s most vulnerable citizens. They take on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (a.k.a. CAFOs), which are notorious for producing large amounts of untreated waste. Neighbors of these facilities have been subjected to a myriad of health issues, stemming from the harmful conditions there. This documentary chronicles the plight of five communities dealing with these extremely unfortunate circumstances. Their needs aren t much; they re basic necessities many of us take for granted, such as clean air and water. The lack of regulation and oversight into the offending companies is certainly discouraging. But instead of being apathetic, these brave citizens have decided to rise up and rally against the corporate behemoths who ignore their calls for change. It s challenging to see the harm that s been inflicted on them, but their inspiring resilience is beautifully captured in this exceptionally compelling film.  E.F.<br>Director: Matt Wechsler and Annie Speicher are a husband-and-wife filmmaking team from Evanston, Illinois with a passion for sustainable agriculture. Their first collaboration, Sustainable, screened at over 40 festivals worldwide and received the 2016 Global Humanitarian Award for Outstanding Achievement.</p></div></a>

He s unemployed, rejected from the military for being mentally unstable, and lives at home with his ailing and nagging mother. When it comes to dating, things aren t any better, as women don t exactly find his approach charming. Instead of looking inward, Ronnie finds an outlet for his frustration online. The alt-right community gives him a place to belong and absolves his personal responsibility his problems aren t his fault, they tell him. Instead, the blame belongs with weak progressives who are trying to emasculate men and impose their multicultural, feminist agenda. Ronnie becomes obsessed with this conspiratorial rhetoric, clinging to values about defending America from immigrants (literally, with guns) and preserving the dominance of the white race. He idolizes the social media stars of the  revolution  and soon becomes one himself, with his popular, hate-fueled video rants. But Ronnie has an incredibly scandalous secret that could destroy the macho persona he s been clinging to and his golden reputation in the movement.

You re not alone. Luckily, TRUST MACHINE: THE STORY OF BLOCKCHAIN narrated by award-winning actress Rosario Dawson serves to sort through the confusion. This well-researched documentary chronicles the incredible rise of Bitcoin, an internet currency based on a concept known as a blockchain. Using cryptography, the information contained in records (a.k.a.  blocks ) is resistant from modification or hacking. Money isn t the only thing this technology can be used for. The film profiles start-ups that are applying it to social causes, medical records, identification purposes, copyright claims, and even voting. While this all sounds very promising, there are still many skeptics. Some simply find it too complex and/or view it as a sly tool for criminals. Others could be rendered obsolete if blockchains replace existing infrastructure. Is the opposition for self-preservation, or are they right in characterizing cryptocurrency as an overhyped Ponzi scheme? Get the facts and decide for yourself after watching this compelling explanation of a misunderstood modern technology.

In the 1970s, the New York City borough lost almost 80% of its housing to fires, displacing 250,000 residents from their homes. Once a thriving, integrated community of African American, Irish, Italian, Hispanic, Jewish, and Puerto Rican families, the South Bronx fell victim to racially-targeted government policies and city-wide budget cuts. When redlining went into effect, barring minorities from obtaining mortgage loans or insurance policies, landlords continued to pocket rent checks but neglected to take care of their buildings. Aging structures susceptible to fires ignited years of devastating damage, with no end or help in sight. Neighborhood fire departments closed, while the media and public officials claimed the minority residents were somehow to blame for burning down their own communities. In this intense documentary, Vivian Va zquez Irizarry and Gretchen Hildebran explore why this block was forgotten and how dedicated residents continue to fight to save their neighborhoods in DECADE OF FIRE.

Thanks to some friendly strangers, he hitchhikes his way to find help, suspecting the police in these parts may be on the wrong side of the law. The way of life for his new companions, Vova (a middle-aged man with his sights set on a new metal detector), and his free-spirited daughter, Marushka, seems mundane yet carefree. With military tanks cruising the desolate land, days with Vova and Marushka become Lucas s informal safety net. As he attempts to find help and return to his normal life, this new version of unofficial anarchy feels both chaotic and intriguing. As each quirky, dangerous turn of events unfolds, VOLCANO delivers unexpected themes of sullen contemplation, subtle romance, and a vague humor that erupt at just the right time.

Its characters are young and hungry for Western music in a country where listening to it can lead to arrest. At the Leningrad Rock Club, Soviet bands can play sanitized sets with approved lyrics to tamed crowds who aren t allowed to dance, mosh, or even show excessive enthusiasm for the music. Serebrennikov s impassioned film revolves around Mike, a major star in the scene who also grooms and records new artists. He s recently discovered Viktor, whose band is sure to be the next big thing. Mike takes him under his wing, introducing him to Lou Reed and David Bowie, while prepping him for a make-or-break performance at the Leningrad Rock Club. But their budding friendship gets confusing when Mike s wife develops her own feelings for Viktor. This bizarre love triangle will scratch at the fabric of their reckless and disaffected youth. Watching everything change around them, they ll learn that, like summer, nothing lasts forever.

New York and other centers of gay life have new generations of LGBTQ people who feel free and safe. Over the years, however, another ravaging threat has continued to rise: crystal meth, a synthetic drug that found quick and willing harbor in the gay dance and sex club scene. Delivering a manic rush to intensify physical and sexual activity, addiction is almost instantaneous. This frightening but hopeful documentary explores the myriad causes and effects of crystal meth addiction, charting the long (and sometimes agonizing) path to recovery. The stories bravely told by these men, either recovering or currently using, are raw, shocking, and honest. Both a warning siren and a beacon of hope, CRYSTAL CITY focuses on LGBTQ people even though this crisis touches everyone. After surviving AIDS as a powerful and joyful culture, the gay community must once again unite against a new killer.

Taken to an abandoned building deep in the forest, the children are left with few adults and even fewer provisions. The shelter soon becomes a different sort of prison. German guard dogs from the abandoned camps, mad with hunger, encircle the woods around them. The guardians are killed by the pack and the children are again alone, fighting for their lives. WEREWOLF is beautifully crafted to sustain a grim fairytale atmosphere of isolation and dread. It is a horror story in the purest sense, one in which the monsters are not necessarily what you think. Some prowl on four legs, others on two. Some are born in the hearts and minds of children who witness terrors nobody should see. WEREWOLF is a gruesome but hopeful fable for our times, in which we are reminded that the war between savagery and civilization is an endless one.

Based on Anna Seghers  1942 novel, Transit, this suspense-filled film follows Georg as he escapes to Marseilles and takes on the author s identity. As he dodges German troops sweeping into France, he crosses paths with a variety of elusive characters, including a deaf woman and her spirited son, Driss, a mercurial, mistrustful doctor panicked about the growing conflict, and the dead writer s wife, Marie, a melodramatic figure whose intentions are never quite clear. Such ambiguity also permeates TRANSIT s setting although ostensibly about World War II-inspired events, the film possesses a modern sheen that adds intriguing depth and plot twists that wrestle with the slippery nature of reality and personal ethics when survival is at stake. However, TRANSIT s violent political backdrop is portrayed with gripping realism, lending tension and desperation to Georg s encounters and eventual sacrifices.

Thankfully, there s Canada, our friendly neighbors to the North, who welcomed 27,000 refugees (just 6,000 fewer than America) in 2017 alone, despite having a tenth of the U.S. population. Many of the refugees came from Syria and Iraq, and their journeys to safety were physically and mentally taxing. To tell the story of their experience, Academy Award -winning director Barbara Kopple uses a unique and creative setting: summer camp. Located on a small island in the Canadian wilderness, Camp Pathfinder has given boys from Canada and the U.S. a place to belong for over a century. A few years ago, its director saddened and disturbed by what he was seeing in the news decided to give refugees the opportunity to attend the camp. Kopple s film chronicles their stay, beautifully capturing the bonds of new friendship. But not all the boys are able to escape the mindset of war. The unfathomable horrors they ve witnessed have stripped them of their innocence. Through the eyes of these youngsters, NEW HOMELAND documents the highs and lows of starting over.

The epidemic knows no boundaries, affecting people from all walks of life, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Many times, the problem is presented simply from a perspective of statistics. Directors Pat McGee and Adam Linkenhelt hope to change that with their incredibly intimate documentary, AMERICAN RELAPSE. The film humanizes the issue by connecting viewers with real people whose lives have been upended by drug addiction. Filmed in Florida, the main subjects are Frankie and Allie, two recovering addicts who have devoted their time to helping others get clean and navigate the complicated rehab industry. They ve given the filmmakers one weekend of inside access to their mentally exhaustive line of work. Their personal experiences, which give them the upper hand in relating to their clients, can also present struggles for their own sobriety. Still surrounded by drugs, the temptation to use is as intense as it ever was. This raw and transparent documentary, which doesn t use kid gloves, offers an unfiltered approach to drive home the severity of this heartbreaking crisis.  E.F.<br>Director: Pat McGee is an award-winning showrunner and director in both film and television. McGee produced the Dopesick Nation original series and executive produced and directed the YouTube Original feature documentary, The Deported. A passionate filmmaker, Adam Linkenhelt worked extensively as supervising producer on 24 to Life, LMNs highest rated show in 2016. He dove headfirst into the opioid epidemic co-directing AMERICAN RELAPSE, which led to a ten-episode docuseries he produced on Viceland.</p></div></a>

The bloody battle ended nine months later in victory for Iraq, but it came at a high cost. While the exact numbers are still unknown, the estimated death toll was somewhere around 10,000 people, with over 3,000 being civilians. At one point, ISIS began kidnapping innocent citizens, barbarically using them as human shields. Besides the loss of lives, the structural damage to the city was devastating. In director Dan Gabriel s eye-opening documentary, MOSUL, viewers are given an unparalleled amount of access to the infamous conflict. The film is assembled from point-of-view combat footage and raw interviews taken by Iraqi journalist, Ali Maula, and his crew. Making the documentary wasn t easy as the filmmakers risked death, ducking sniper fire and carefully avoiding car bombs. Adding to the film s authenticity is the fact that Gabriel did six tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He and Maula s personal experiences and vast knowledge of the region make this an important and in-depth documentary on the subject. (In English and Arabic with subtitles)  E.F.<br>Director: Dan Gabriel's storytelling is inspired by his work as a former Central Intelligence Agency officer in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In fact, replicas of famous landmarks around the world are more common than you might think. Traveling to China, India, and West Africa to capture these replicas, and to explore the motivations behind them, THE REAL THING brings forth questions of authenticity and originality. While some see these re-creations as a sign of harmonious integration of Eastern and Western cultures, others find them to be odd and distasteful. Either way, the juxtaposition of European architecture in the middle of Chinese cities makes for an alluring image. Beautifully bizarre and curiously captivating, THE REAL THING is a one-of-a-kind documentary about some surprisingly not so one-of-a-kind landmarks.

With 45 seconds left, Pacer Ron Artest, already notorious for his volcanic temper, sparked an altercation that soon erupted into the stands and became the most shameful and violent incident in NBA history. QUIET STORM is the story of Ron Artest (aka Metta World Peace). Where most documentaries focus on a familiar arc of struggle and triumph, this film dares to go deeper. Beginning with Artest s childhood in New York s infamous Queensbridge projects, the film charts his development as a man and a basketball player. It also documents the rise of New York s crack epidemic and the vicious street culture that gripped the city. Artest not only needed to survive his neighborhood, but he also had to deal with a personal and family history of mental illness. Fearless and honest in its handling of difficult themes, QUIET STORM is presented with narrative force and the energy of a playoff game. It is a story you may have heard, but never like this.  C.R.<br>Director: Born and raised in New York City, Johnny Sweet graduated from Syracuse University in 2003. He was an Emmy Award-winning feature producer at ESPN for ten years, primarily covering the NBA and the NFL.

However, Morrison s climb to preeminence was not an easy one. and recognition from the literary establishment was slow to arrive. Her life began on the racially integrated streets of Lorain, Ohio in a home with parents who strongly encouraged her interest in reading and education. But it was quite a culture shock when she experienced institutionalized segregation as a Howard University student when off-campus in Washington, DC. Morrison subsequently held a series of teaching positions before landing a L.W. Singer editing role, which changed the trajectory of her life. Her work led her to become the first black woman senior fiction editor for Random House. Morrison s instinctive influence helped bring black fiction authors into the mainstream while encouraging autobiographies by activists such as Angela Davis and Mohammed Ali. Meanwhile, she began writing her own work and published The Bluest Eye (1970), Sula (1973), Son of Solomon (1977), and Tar Baby (1981) with a focus on inspiring an African American audience. Broad acclaim did not arrive as quickly, and there was an outcry by dozens of black critics and writers after her 1987 epic novel, Beloved, failed to win major book awards. But many factors, including that protest and ongoing praise and engagement of Morrison s work from such people as Oprah Winfrey, steered her to the universal praise she always deserved. TONI MORRISON: THE PIECES I AM offers an intimate portrait of an American icon whose early life was shaped here in Northeast Ohio.   Patrick Shepherd<br>Director: Timothy Greenfield-Sanders is known for his strikingly intimate portraits of major cultural figures. His portraits can be found in such collections as the Modern Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum. He has produced and directed 13 documentaries and won a Grammy Award for "Lou Reed: Rock and Roll Heart" and an NAACP Image Award for "The Black List."</p></div></a>

This vision was GENERAL MAGIC, one of the most important and influential companies almost nobody has ever heard of. A spin-off of Apple, their vision was to create a mobile computer that had  the tactile satisfaction of a seashell and the enchantment of a crystal.  This little start-up in Silicon Valley became a madcap joyride of creation that wound up producing the ideas and beginnings of the smartphones the world relies on today. Part of this wild adventure was the self-documentation of the process wonderful footage this enthralling documentary incorporates into an unfathomably strange and marvelous piece of history. The device in your pocket (which you have silenced for this film, of course) was born in a cauldron of pure genius and epic failure. Whether you view technology as humankind s salvation or as its apocalypse, GENERAL MAGIC will cast a spell upon you.  C.R.<br>Director: Before moving back to London, Sarah Kerruish lived in Silicon Valley for 15 years where she worked as a filmmaker with some of the great inventors of our age. Her films have been distributed worldwide and won many awards, including a Peabody and an Emmy nomination. As a former Magician herself, Kerruish's unparalleled access to the subjects in the film allowed her the greatest insight and intimacy to the heart of the story.

For much of the nation, these horrific acts may feel like a distant memory. But when 17-year-old Lennon Lacy was found hanging from a swing set in rural North Carolina in 2014, the police department s quick ruling of a suicide contradicted blatant evidence he may have been lynched. ALWAYS IN SEASON explores the suspicious circumstances of the Lacy case, along with numerous other historic lynchings in communities still struggling to reconcile their past. The documentary travels to Georgia, where controversial reenactments of a 1946 quadruple lynching take place each year, and reenactors include family members of former Ku Klux Klan followers and supporters. A required history lesson and a chilling look at deep-seated racism still present today, ALWAYS IN SEASON reveals how communities aim to seek justice and healing from our divided history and educate the next generation for a united future.

Did insiders anticipate its arrival and, if so, why didn t they do more to stop it? Jennifer Deschamps explores these questions and more in her eye-opening documentary, INSIDE LEHMAN BROTHERS. The film profiles several former Lehman employees who discuss the corruption and lies that went on within the company. At the crux of the matter: sub-prime mortgages were sold to people who clearly couldn t afford them and, in some cases, records were intentionally fudged. These employees noticed the errors and warned their bosses, which could have prevented Lehman s bankruptcy and the notorious market crash. Instead of being rewarded, they became targets as it was made crystal clear their whistleblowing was unwelcome and they should keep quiet. Female employees tearfully recall when they were sexually harassed. The threats became so bad, they actually feared for their lives. This starkly honest film gives viewers a deeper look into an unnecessary crisis that personally affected many. It also offers crucial warning signs to avoid a repeat disaster.  E.F.<br>Director: Jennifer Deschamps is an editorial producer and a director at KM, the French production company. Passionate about cinema and literature, after studying international law and political science, she turned to making documentaries.

Of those films, male characters received twice as much screen time as female characters. These statistics are probably not surprising to any woman who has worked in the film industry; but for the rest of us, those are shocking numbers. So how did we get here? If women make up 50% of the human population, then why are we so underrepresented? Why aren t our stories being told? Providing the answers to these questions and many more, THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING is an enlightening, highly informative, and deeply moving documentary about sex discrimination and the #MeToo Movement in Hollywood. Recognizing that sexual harassment and abuse are biproducts of employment inequality, several brave women are pushing back and uniting to say enough is enough. Subjects of the film include Gena Davis, Meryl Streep, Natalie Portman, Taraji P. Henson, Reese Witherspoon, and Cate Blanchett just to name a few. And if these star appearances aren t enough to grab your attention, the cold hard facts of gender discrimination will.  G.S.<br>Director: Producers</p></div></a>

Still, he s assigned to the Los Amigos organization, and when he arrives to begin coaching, it s clear he has his work cut out for him.

But after beginning her interview process in Germany, she felt there was a piece missing in the story she wanted to tell the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians. As a young girl growing up in Israel, Ofra was taught to fear both Germans and Palestinians. Today, with bravery, compassion, and a willingness to listen, Ofra creates a unique space for raw and honest conversation with her perceived enemies. Using her personal experience as a focal point, AFTERWARD explores the very real trauma that has been passed down through generations not only in Jewish families, but also in German and Palestinian families. By listening to and acknowledging each other s transgenerational suffering, can we create a path that leads to peace?

Dara spent weekends with her Take That VHS tape, memorizing each member s dance moves and harmonies in case someone fell ill and, by chance, needed her to fill in. When Beatlemania hit, Susan fantasized about John Lennon and stood screaming in unending seas of young girls. I USED TO BE NORMAL: A BOYBAND FANGIRL STORY steps into the lives of four women s unconditional love for their respective generation s greatest boyband. Each one unapologetically delves into her obsession, baring not only keepsake boxes of concert tickets, autographs, and photo collages, but also insightful expressions of how their boyband fandom has influenced their career paths, relationships, and worldview.

It may sound like the plot of some exploitation film, but it s actually a summary of BREAKING HABITS, an explosive documentary directed by Robert Ryan. The story follows Christine Meeusen, a divorced former corporate executive who turns to growing and selling cannabis after discovering her husband was a bigamist and a thief. Meeusen s business in Merced, California isn t just some shady operation, though; the marijuana they distribute is for medicinal use only. Seeing medical marijuana as a way to heal the sick, Meeusen adopted the persona of  Sister Kate,  and, fittingly, her company was coined Sisters of the Valley. Neither she nor any of the other nuns in the group are affiliated with a particular religious order, but the service they provide certainly feels like a miracle to those who need it. Unfortunately for the sisters, not everyone is pleased with their mission. Whether battling state regulators or protecting their crops from the cartels (hence the aforementioned guns), these rebel sisters remain tough as nails. Ryan s film is wild and fun, but also indispensable in its examination of the fast-changing marijuana industry.  E.F.<br>Director: Robert Ryan is a director, writer, and producer. Before pursuing feature films, his projects include TV series and TV movie documentaries.</p></div></a>

But the reality of what was waiting for them was an entirely different story. Violence, cruelty, and a terrifying lack of humanity would cause unimaginable suffering and loss. Those who survived would endure some of the worst treatment. Based on real events, SOBIBOR portrays the horrific atrocities that took place within one of the largest extermination camps in Poland, as well as the infamous uprising that followed, in which 600 prisoners made a massive escape attempt, killing 11 SS officers in the process. The revolt was led by Soviet officer Alexander Pechersky, who was being held in Sobibor as a prisoner of war. Although any acts of defiance were met with severe and often lethal punishments, enough resilience and hope remained to carry out an impossible plan.

But as some have learned, not all speech is covered by it. One such exception is obscenity, defined by Merriam-Webster as  any utterance or act that strongly offends the prevalent morality of the time  a glaringly subjective concept. Nevertheless, Florida illustrator Mike Diana learned this the hard way in 1994 when he became the first American artist to be convicted of obscenity. He was punished with fines, probation, community service, psychological testing, and an order to stay away from children. Mike s big offense: publishing what was deemed an inappropriate comic book. Because the court found his twisted, ultra-violent, sex-filled Boiled Angels series  lacked serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value,  a harmless young cartoonist became a criminal. BOILED ANGELS: THE TRIAL OF MIKE DIANA cleverly chronicles the unbelievable story, while also recounting the misunderstood history of underground comics from the moral panic of the 50s to the controversial work of Robert Crumb. Narrated by punk icon, Jello Biafra (Dead Kennedys), this boisterous documentary profiles an unlikely free speech hero.

They began seeing themselves as more progressive and politically-armed. Nevertheless, with the word  Satan  in their organization s name, they re often misunderstood and reviled.

Tre, 13, is a rebellious and defiant aspiring rapper. Maison, 11, is a precocious and energetic young man whose vocabulary far exceeds that of most preteens. And Dasan, six, is a sweet and tender-hearted boy who is often shy in front of the camera. What unites Tre, Maison, and Dasan is that each of them has a parent in prison and they are not alone. Currently, one in 14 children in the United States have an incarcerated parent.

Dylan, singer for the Wallflowers, solo artist, and son of Bob, acts as interviewer, speaking to a variety of artists who were integral to the sounds that came out of the iconic Los Angeles neighborhood. The movement began when traditional folk music peaked. Access to electric instruments and more advanced recording technology spawned experimentation and innovation. Many elements of folk remained, but it was louder, more sonically interesting, and less limiting. This new style was ushered in by The Byrds and was soon followed by such acts as The Mamas and the Papas, Buffalo Springfield, and The Beach Boys. Members of these legendary bands describe the communal environment that existed strong friendships were formed and neighborhood jam sessions were quite common. Dylan interviews other prominent musicians who were influenced by the Laurel Canyon trailblazers, including Eric Clapton and Jackson Browne. But it s his excellent conversation with the late Tom Petty that s the cherry on an already sweet chronicle of the folk rock explosion.  E.F.<br>Director: Andrew Slater is a former music critic for the Atlanta Journal Constitution and frequent contributor to Billboard, Rolling Stone, and People. As a creative director and record producer, he worked with acts such as Stevie Nicks, Don Henley, Lenny Kravitz, Beastie Boys, and The Wallflowers, among others.</p></div></a>

She hits the January sales at a prestigious department store (with the most sinister sales staff ever) and buys a beautiful red dress. In the lining is sewn the motto,  You who will wear me will know me.  Very soon the fabric of reality will be ripped open and the forces of evil will enter. IN FABRIC is a retro love song to the wonderful drive-in horror double-features of decades past. Using nostalgically over-the-top cinematic flourishes, nerve-tweaking electronic music, and old-school shock, this tale of a haunted dress and the horrors it brings to its wearers is fitted with a very twisted and darkly humored script. It skewers consumer and corporate culture with needle-sharp wit while delivering genuine chills. Weaving these elements together smartly, IN FABRIC is carefully tailored to hem the viewer in with laughter and fear. It proves that some things, like satanic salespeople, bloody terror, and demonic possession, never go out of style.

He attended Reading Blue Coat School, Sonning-on-Thames and has worked in drama, psychological thriller, and horror genres.</p></div></a>

Her film company, which produces gay porn, is devastated after several of its young actors are brutally murdered. She has broken up with her lover, Lois, who also edits the company s films, and her drinking is escalating. Her disturbing response to these crises is to begin producing porn films that mirror the realities of the killings. Increasingly bizarre occurrences begin swirling about Anne, as does a mysterious black bird that precedes the murders and the appearance of the masked killer. Maybe Anne s life is a film. The line between the celluloid and the certain is becoming terrifyingly blurred. Something unexplainable, perhaps unnatural, is tightening its grip. An ending of B-movie proportions may be facing Anne and everyone around her. KNIFE+HEART plays gleefully and stylishly with the borders of reality, mixing film genres in an erotic and violent brew. Remember: those horrors you ve seen in films may be real and lurking in the row behind you. (In French with subtitles)  C.R.<br>Director: Yann Gonzalez was born in 1977 in Nice.

Rocky Horror Picture Show?   Mommie Dearest?  How about  A Nightmare on Elm Street 2?  Thirty-three years after its release, the horror sequel is still regarded as a gay camp classic, full of homophobic and homoerotic images. For one young actor, it was a true nightmare, effectively ending his film career. SCREAM, QUEEN! MY NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is a high-energy and thoughtful documentary that picks multiple fights and wins them all. It is the story of Mark Patton, the young gay star of the film. It is the tale of a homophobic and AIDS-phobic 1980s Hollywood. Finally, it is a look at the script of David Chaskin, who claimed there was no gay intent but blamed the film s gayness on Mark.  Nightmare 2  labeled Mark as the new Scream Queen and forced him into Garbo-like exile. Mark is back now and ready to talk, big time. Full of wonderful film clips and celebrities, this is a defiant and triumphant story that nonetheless cautions today s LGBTQ community that the nightmare isn t over.

Now he is finally releasing his long overdue follow-up,  No Self  an odd mix examining his inability to maintain relationships, coupled with Buddhist philosophy. The film s incompatible elements reflect Benjamin perfectly. He s an appealingly dysfunctional stew of insecurity, strange acquaintances, and bushels of boyish charm. Further complicating his creative and personal tailspin is Noah, a handsome young singer whom Benjamin is instantly smitten with. When  No Self  premieres, it is a critical disaster. Life may stubbornly insist on imitating art because it seems his affair with Noah won t get rave reviews either unless he learns to truly open himself to success and love. BENJAMIN follows the ups and downs of this adorable pair as they try to build lives that nurture both art and the artist.

STRESS takes us to the working-class neighborhoods of the Steel City to document the lives of these brave men and women who saw a lifetime s worth of combat fighting for our country in Afghanistan. With their backs to the camera or shown discreetly going about their day, each vet shares their commentary of what motivated them to join the service, the grueling experiences of war, and their longing to find a new purpose and identity as civilians. War has changed them forever. Yet perhaps the harder battlefield is back here at home, where they struggle to relate to loved ones, manage symptoms of PTSD, and assimilate to an otherwise safe environment that still keeps them in a dangerous state of high alert. Profoundly honest and conflicted, STRESS targets public perceptions of servicemen and women, an astounding veteran suicide rate, and the resilience of our vets in their fight to find peace.

That s the central premise of the quietly moving documentary JAY MYSELF, which follows legendary New York City photographer, Jay Maisel, as he moves out of the 35,000-square-foot, six-floor former bank he bought for a song and dance in 1966 and now is selling in the largest private real estate deal in New York City history. The packing process is arduous, since he spent decades amassing intriguing objects (e.g., mannequin hands and unopened rolls of film) that others might consider junk. But as movers slowly empty the Lower East Side building, Maisel starts reflecting on his thought-provoking philosophy toward art and photography and his deep attachment to the space.  It is a refuge, and it is an obligation,  he says.  And it is a source and a drain for creative energy.  By the end, JAY MYSELF becomes more about coming to terms with the passage of time, while never losing sight of the beauty that exists in the mundane.  A.Z.<br>Director: Since opening his studio in New York City in 1983, photographer Stephen Wilkes has built an unprecedented body of work and a reputation as one of America's most iconic photographers, widely recognized for his fine art, editorial and commercial work.</p></div></a>

But his reputation as a feared, provocative interviewer was not easily gained. This film navigates Wallace s path through the early, experimental days of television with work on game shows, a string of advertising gigs, and finally programs that featured a groundbreaking interview style with Eleanor Roosevelt, Salvador Dali, and Gloria Swanson. He struggled to be taken seriously in CBS s Walter Cronkite newsroom as he faced personal struggles and insecurities that he worked diligently to conceal. The 1968 offer to serve as a correspondent on a new but untested type of investigative project, 60 Minutes, was a turning point. While the show wasn't an immediate success, stories about Watergate and the Vietnam War helped it gain traction and ultimately become the most-watched news magazine on television. Wallace aggressively interrogated figures such as U.S. Army General William Westmoreland, Iran s Ayatollah Khomeini, and Russia s Vladmir Putin throughout the decades. And he fought his CBS bosses when they shelved his explosive interview with tobacco industry insider, Jeffrey Wigand. All the while, he suffered from depression and finally relented to a question from Morley Safer, sharing a dark secret later in his career. This film is a must-see for anyone interested in the media and its evolution since the early years of Edward R. Murrow, Helen Thomas, and Max Robinson.

Belkin is currently directing a new true-crime series with Delirio Films and Blumhouse for AMC.</p></div></a>

The church, his friends, and even his own mother ostracize him, and he cannot get funding to do further work. After reading an ethnography about the impoverished Las Hurdes region in Spain, Bu uel enlists the help of friends to fund and film a documentary about the region, ostensibly to stop the suffering there and reclaim his artistic reputation. But Bu uel has odd ideas about reality, and his supposedly humanitarian documentary is becoming something darker and personal. Told beautifully in animation, with film from the actual documentary, BU&Ntilde;UEL IN THE LABYRINTH OF THE TURTLES is a rare and unusual meditation on the nature of art and the torment of the artist. The decision to animate this disturbing story for adults is a thoughtful one, lending an air of appropriate surrealism to a very real look at a difficult man transgressing the lines between what is true and what art wants to make true.

As the preacher s daughter, Mara (Alice Englert) is seen as a prime example of purity in her religious society but Mara has a secret that might tear her town apart. Though she s committed to marrying a devout and well-respected Garrett, her heart lies with her childhood sweetheart, Augie (Thomas Mann), who has strayed from the church. Though Mara has always placed her faith in God s plan, as her own life starts to unravel, she begins to question the morality of what she s been taught.

Day in and day out, their skateboarding sessions are interrupted by Football and Chola, two stray dogs who send their balls into the skate pools and bark until one of their human friends retrieve them. As the canine keepers of Los Reyes, Football and Chola spend their days forcing the skaters into games of fetch, lounging in the shade, and barking at vehicles and passersby. A purely observational documentary, LOS REYES uses intimate shots of the harmonious animals, juxtaposed with disquieting voice-over from the gang of troubled teens who also inhabit the park. Astounding in its minimalism and microfocus, LOS REYES is a refreshingly simple documentary that captures the independent lives and big personalities of two Chilean street dogs and the skatepark they call home. Prepare to laugh, to cry, and to be moved by this exceptionally hypnotic and insightful film. (In Spanish with subtitles)  G.S.<br>Director: Since its inception, the documentary work by Bettina Perut and Ivn Osnovikoff has stood out for the risk and creativity in its themes, treatments, and points of view. With seven feature films to their credit, their poetic journey is full of turning points and mutations that have accompanied the technological and cultural transformations of their time, challenging the most stable and conservative premises of what is meant by documentary filmmaking.</p></div></a>

This lack of representation bothered director Tom Surgal, who decided to devote an entire film to the unconventional style. The result is FIRE MUSIC, a fascinating film that will please both fans and critics alike, while also schooling those unfamiliar with the concept. So what is free jazz? Feeling that other styles of jazz were too limiting, some musicians in the 60s began deconstructing typical conventions, trying out irregular tempos, playing strange notes and chord progressions, and improvising to epic proportions. The goal was to use experimentation to defy traditions, making something completely unique and original. Surgal profiles several prominent artists in the scene, including Ornette Coleman, Pharoah Sanders, Albert Ayler, and John Coltrane. Going against the grain wasn t easy early on friends of Coleman recall the night he was physically assaulted for his offbeat techniques. Eventually, though, artists across the jazz spectrum began incorporating avant-garde methods into their music. This well-researched documentary is an enjoyable tribute to those who think outside the box.  E.F.<br>Director: Writer and director Tom Surgal is known for directing a series of groundbreaking music videos for leading alternative bands such as Sonic Youth, Pavement and The Blues Explosion. A musician and co-leader of the improvisational ensemble, White Out, Surgal is recognized as a leading authority on Avant-Garde Jazz and boasts one the world's largest collections of Free Jazz recordings.</p></div></a>

His full revolutionary impact is revealed in this compelling documentary from Academy Award -winning director Brigitte Berman. In 1959, Hefner started a television program called Playboy s Penthouse. Set up to look like an apartment party, the variety show featured a slew of legendary performers. But it was its racial diversity that stood out most. Years before MTV was pressured to play black artists, Hefner gave them representation, regardless of the consequences. Despite it being the time of Jim Crow, everyone was treated as equals on Hefner s show, much to the chagrin of some Americans. The program was canceled after two seasons, but reemerged later as Playboy After Dark, which continued to push for equality. In addition to performances from artists such as James Brown, Tina Turner, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Buddy Rich, the show featured candid conversations about censorship, racism, and progressive politics. Going beyond the bunnies, HUGH HEFNER S AFTER DARK: SPEAKING OUT IN AMERICA examines Hefner s unheralded role as civil rights activist.  E.F.<br>Director: Brigitte Berman is an Academy Award-winning producer, director and writer who was born in Frankfurt, Germany, and graduated from Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, where she studied English and Film.

Against his parents  wishes, Petr insists on getting a job at the mine alongside his father, Milan, a principled hard worker recently traumatized by the underground death of his best friend, Pavel.

The extent to which we have altered the Earth is astounding. But the harsh reality can be difficult to grasp without images, especially now that we are so often removed from the origins of our most prominent resources. Using a wide-lens approach, filmmaker Jennifer Baichwal teams up with world-renowned photographer, Edward Burtynsky, to capture heavily industrialized landscapes, and the people who inhabit them, from around the world. From shipyards in Bangladesh, to the rapidly growing neighborhoods of Shanghai, to small towns in China that have been completely contaminated by electronic waste, Baichwal and Burtynsky provoke new ways of thinking with the powerful images they present. As the first in Jennifer Baichwal s trilogy of documentaries that explore humanity s relationship with our planet, MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES is the big zoom-out our society needs to get some perspective.  G.S.<br>Director: Jennifer Baichwal has been directing and producing documentaries for over 20 years. Her films have won multiple awards including an International Emmy, three Gemini Awards, and Best Cultural and Best Independent Canadian Documentary at HotDocs.

Steven K. Bannon is one. Whether you love him as the salvation of our country or loathe him as the agent of its destruction, his influence is undeniable. This documentary follows Bannon from his departure as White House chief strategist in 2017 until the mid-term elections of 2018. Freed from his  political shackles,  Bannon pushed his  economic nationalist  message to help Republicans keep control of Congress in the mid-terms, as well as assist nationalist movements in Europe. Here is Bannon, raw and unfiltered, whose worldviews either elate or horrify and who has the skills to articulate them persuasively. THE BRINK does not avoid any controversies and follows Bannon as he faces his critics. Whether you are a soldier in Bannon s war or see his views as corrosive and evil, this fascinating film reveals a man who, for good or ill, is a force on the world stage.

To keep a $6.5 billion seafood industry afloat with no line of employees willing to work on these boats for years at a time, Thai fishing companies kidnap and coerce men into slavery to man their ships.

Abel steps aside but never stops loving her. Years later, Paul suddenly dies in his sleep. At the funeral, Abel reconnects with Marianne and meets her young son, Joseph. He also reconnects with Paul s young sister, Eve, now an attractive woman. Eve always had a crush on Abel, never understanding why Marianne chose her brother over Abel. Feelings long buried are about to re-emerge, and their relationships are about to get complicated. A FAITHFUL MAN lets each of these characters narrate his or her own story and viewpoints. While the story wafts along like a pleasant spring breeze, the underlying longing and pain of these individuals adds a bittersweet spice. At cross-purposes with each other, as well as themselves, finding love and happiness has suddenly become a snarl nobody is sure how to untangle, a charming and wistful quest as unpredictable as the human heart.

Now, after being denied visitation, she helps Denis escape from the institution. Denis is thrilled, believing it is maternal love motivating her. But Oksana needs him. The disease that caused her to abandon him now makes Denis useful. He has congenital analgesia, a complex condition that prevents him from feeling pain. Denis becomes the JUMPMAN, flinging himself in front of targeted cars, blackmailing the drivers into huge cash payments to avoid prosecution. This cold and corrupt scheme winds through both the medical and law enforcement establishments, destroying lives. The money pours in and mother and son prosper. But Denis can only be used for so long. His increasing rebellion makes him expendable, even to his mother. Denis must now face the true nature of his filial bond and his growing sense of personal dignity, as well as discover the true meaning of home. JUMPMAN tosses itself at you with full impact.

Her readings indicate potentially serious issues for the developers data they want her to suppress. But a mysterious woman approaches her at the site, warning her not to let work begin. She claims to be the Virgin Mary and starts appearing at Lucia s home and wherever else she goes. Of course, nobody else can see her, and Lucia feels she may be going mad. So she refuses the Virgin s commands. But this is no misty apparition. This Virgin turns out to be one tough lady who will not be told no, resorting to physical coercion if needed. For Lucia to prove she s sane and convince the developers a church must be built on the site instead, well, it may take a miracle. LUCIA S GRACE explores the line between cynicism and spirituality with honesty, humor, and great warmth. In an age when we define wonder with smart-phones and choose only facts we like, maybe divine intervention is just what we need.

To put it simply, these super-jacked individuals lift some insanely heavy weights. In fact, one Westsider had a combined record of 3,005 pounds. The owner of the invitation-only gym is Louie Simmons, a former champion lifter who rewrote the rules on weight training (today, his techniques are used in other professional and collegiate sports). Louie now in his mid-60s is notoriously rough. Under his roof, you re either breaking records or you re out. The environment is brutally cut-throat with less than stellar conditions as Westside has been housed in garages and rundown strip malls. Brawls and shouting matches are commonplace, with athletes literally working until (or while) they bleed. Louie is obviously doing something right. Many of the lifters consider him a father figure, and Westside consistently produces some of the best athletes in the sport. Narrated by Ron Perlman, WESTSIDE VS. THE WORLD is a fascinating, in-depth documentary about the intense, fiercely competitive world of powerlifting.  E.F.<br>Director: Michael Fahey has worked on many sports and health documentaries, as well as the NFL Network, E!, and Travel Channel. Since starting work on his film in 2014, Michael has squatted 545 pounds, bench pressed 365 pounds, and deadlifted 515 pounds  all raw, gym lifts.</p></div></a>

In one of these savage attacks, Albert s daughter and granddaughter are killed. His grandson, David, survives, but is seriously injured. Albert promises David justice, meaning the killers will be punished. During the haphazard investigations, which give the appearance of a cover-up, Albert is approached by a reporter suspecting deep corruption and conspiracy. He wants to help, but he fears placing his surviving family in peril. Based on real events, DON T SHOOT looks at both the pain these acts leave in their wake and the strength of survivors. As Albert begins what will become decades of fighting for the truth to be found, his family deals with trying to reclaim life within a system they can never again trust. For all its terrifying realism, DON T SHOOT is ultimately an elegantly crafted and moving profile in courage. It is a powerful tale of political cowardice and individual bravery, one that inspires and unsettles with its chilling immediacy.

The village was first established as a safe haven for Holocaust survivors who immigrated to the U.S. after the war. Since then, Kiryas Joel has thrived and expanded. A growing population and the high demand for housing have led to an annexation proposal of 507 additional acres of land. But for the rest of the Monroe community, many of whom moved to the town to get closer to nature, the encroaching Kiryas Joel is bad news. An opposition group, United Monroe, is gaining support to limit further development of the Hasidic community. But when anti-Semitism, fear, and an  us vs. them  mentality come into play, things have the potential to get ugly. A documentary with incredible access to both sides, CITY OF JOEL tells the fascinating story of a modern day turf war and the complex issues that arise when cultures collide.

For such an isolated child, the bird was a lifesaver both figuratively and literally. Will Mike s memories of Mr. Percival inspire him to stop Malcolm?

Fuguain found a corpse outside his apartment complex and is considered the prime suspect. When Buron is briefly called away, he appoints his one-eyed assistant, Phillipe, to guard the suspect. But Phillipe has an awful (and fatal) accident. Fearing he will be suspected of two deaths, Fuguain hides the corpse. Now, as the interrogation resumes, things go from merely strange to utterly bizarre. With the very darkest of humor, KEEP AN EYE OUT proudly disdains such tiresome plot devices as time, logic, reality, and, yes, even plot. As more evidence is revealed, Fuguain s innocence looks increasingly doubtful, as does the competence and sanity of the police. You may begin to question yours. With a dead policeman in the closet and people inconveniently time-traveling, it all leads to an ending that might be called, with polite understatement, freaking surreal. These are the wonderful and twisted little gems you come here for. Bon appe tit. (In French with subtitles)  C.R.<br>Director: Director Quentin Dupieux was born in Paris, France.

WILD reveals his days and nights with unflinching honesty and detachment. The explicit, sometimes brutal, sex is portrayed as naturally as the unexpected moments of tenderness and brotherhood with other prostitutes. But drugs and homelessness are taking their toll. WILD compels you with its edgy and stark realism. It takes us deep into a world of bleakness and beauty, of sudden violence and sudden compassion. Will the hope of love with a fellow hustler or the ethereal promises of a way out claim him before sickness does? Can love and redemption be found if he is unsure what they are or how to recognize them? In the end, is it what he truly wants? WILD has the stunning answers.

Such aspirational pictures are meant to reflect fulfilling the dream of pairing up and finding love something still vitally important to Chinese parents while symbolizing the rich life couples hope they have once they re hitched. Yet in the revealing documentary CHINA LOVE, the economic prosperity exuded from these photos also illuminates the deep and sometimes painful generational divides that still exist in China, a country where such lavish displays were once banned. First-time director Olivia Martin-McGuire, an Australia-born photographer living in Shanghai, brings an intimate and sensitive touch to these cultural collisions. Via interviews with modern couples going through the courtship and wedding processes, as well as others who wed during more oppressive regimes. With behind-the-scenes glimpses of the world s biggest pre-wedding photography company, CHINA LOVE examines the fascinating intersection of romantic pragmatism, economic prosperity, and historical traditions.

Now Billingham has adapted their story to a narrative film, told in three parts. In part one, we see Ray and Liz in the present. They re separated and Ray s alcoholism has become unmanageable. The other parts are flashbacks to cataclysmic moments in their past. Poor parenting skills are on display when Liz goes shopping, leaving Richard s little brother alone with his unstable uncle. The scene ends with the toddler holding a knife, while his drunk uncle lays in a pool of vomit. There s dark humor in how it happened, but the dysfunction is jarring. In the last piece, the boys are a little older, fending for themselves as their parents sleep excessively. When the neglect is discovered by outsiders, the consequences are severe. Billingham s film memoir is dark and disturbing but encouraging in how he uses art to work through the trauma. RAY   LIZ explores how depression, and the vices that numb it, can tear a family apart yet create the emotional strength to overcome it.  E.F.<br>Director: Producer</p></div></a>

It follows a small-time Kenyan ivory dealer known simply as X, whose missions to procure elephant tusks have become increasingly difficult as police ramp up protective measures for wildlife. The mood of the people has changed too. Marches and parades in favor of stricter laws against poaching are more and more common. X s partner, Lukas, is the one who actually does the dirty deed, as X is uncomfortable with killing animals, despite the obvious irony in his choice of work. But for these men, selling ivory is a means to support their families. Environmental and ethical issues presented are weighed against the economic benefits. The film also follows Asan, a wildlife ranger who just happens to be X s cousin. The glaring conflict of interest creates discernable tension between them. As the ivory industry begins to burn, X must embrace change or go down in flames. Jon Kasbe s stirring documentary is dark and provocative, offering viewers an intimate glimpse into the ghastly phenomenon of poaching. (In Swahili with subtitles)  E.F.<br>Director: Born to an Australian mother and an Indian father, Jon Kasbe spent most of his childhood traveling.

The film is constructed from three intimate interviews between Herzog and a humble Gorbachev, as well as archival footage and reflections from well-respected politicians and talking heads who ponder his legacy. Gorbachev now 87 makes for a fascinating and charismatic interview subject. And in today s bitter political landscape, it s refreshing to get insight from someone who devoted his time in politics to bringing people together. He was skilled in de-escalation and a champion of compromise, as evidenced by his part in the infamous fall of the Berlin Wall. The film is a celebration of Gorbachev s many accomplishments, as well as an examination of his deepest regrets and personal struggles. Herzog s highly engrossing documentary is certainly informative, but the most compelling component is how deep it takes us into the mind and heart of one of the 20th century s most important leaders.

He founded his own production company in 1963 and has staged several operas in Bayreuth, Germany, and at the Milan Scala in Italy.

Dancing between fiction and documentary, TOUCH ME NOT is an intentionally provocative exploration of three people looking to shatter their personal barriers to intimacy and love. Laura is repulsed by touch and uses various ways to battle this, including a hermaphroditic prostitute, a call boy, and a primal scream therapist. Tomas works with Christian, a man with severe physical challenges who fearlessly seeks to celebrate his unique body while Tomas seems trapped within his more conventional one. Each of them is filmed with an extraordinary intimacy and detail that may discomfort some viewers. They speak openly to us of their journey, allowing us to share at very close proximity both their emotional and physical nakedness. TOUCH ME NOT eschews conventional taboos, inviting us into a controversial, powerful, and ultimately liberating look at the search for self-acceptance and love. Explicit and startling, this is a truly unique cinematic experiment. (In English and German with subtitles)  C.R.<br>Director: Director and writer Adina Pintilie was born in Bucharest, Romania.

The city s homeless population regularly seeks refuge from the elements at the downtown public library, patiently awaiting the doors to open each morning after spending long nights in a shelter or risking their lives out on the street. Stuart Goodson (Emilio Estevez) and his fellow librarians empathize with their patrons, but they walk a fine line to honor the rights of the homeless individuals while respecting other patrons  rights to a safe, comfortable library visit. With overflow shelters at capacity on the coldest night of the year, nearly 100 homeless men, several of whom experience mental illness, hold a peaceful protest in the library, insisting on staying the night to keep warm. The police threaten the use of force to evacuate the patrons, while the media has its own intentions of reporting a version of the story for the sake of ratings instead of the truth. Caught on the frontlines, Stuart, who must choose to succumb to pressures to stand down or immerse himself in the movement.

For stoic former construction worker, Christian, a new job at a massive supermarket functions as all three. Yet the monotony of stocking shelves is mitigated after he falls for Marion, a tough but tender worker in the store s sweets department who s clandestinely navigating a turbulent marriage. She s not the only one with secrets, however. As IN THE AISLES progresses, Christian reveals his own burdens and transgressions to his perceptive mentor, Bruno, who turns out to be hiding his own pain. Despite its somber undertones, the film isn t without its subtle moments of humor; Christian s fumbling attempts to maneuver a forklift especially add irreverent levity. And the affection demonstrated by the store s workers toward one another highlighted by the gentle interactions between Christian and Marion makes IN THE AISLES a surprisingly heartwarming film driven by the sentiment that a job can unexpectedly nurture the soul.

Unsure of her life s purpose or what direction to take, she drifts apathetically between boyfriends and parties. After waking up in the bed of her most recent one-night stand and abruptly quitting her job, Margaux meets an older woman who seems oddly familiar. As they talk, the similarities between the two women become impossible to ignore, starting with their names. Despite bearing little physical resemblance to one another, Margaux and Margaux become convinced they are the same person, 20 years apart. Their relationship becomes even more complicated after young Margaux sleeps with older Margaux s ex-boyfriend and finds herself in the middle of a love triangle  with herself.

The Grand Courts of Europe? No. The Imperial Court of San Francisco, the oldest LGBTQ charity in the world. Found by Jose Sarria in the 1960s, when the gay community was actively persecuted, the Imperial Court began fundraising and organizing gay business owners. They adopted the court system, electing Empresses and Emperors to turn being different into being noble. The extravagant drag and glamor became both a symbol and a celebration of blossoming political power. The gay movement began here. 50 YEARS OF FABULOUS is a heavenly history lesson. The Imperial Court was the center of the LGBTQ community s war against oppression and, later, its fight against AIDS. These are the heroes and heroines you don t admire yet, but will. This glittering documentary is both homage and warning, especially for the generations who think the battle is over. Here is real royalty, courage in high heels, and power with a floor-length gown. We need their majesty more than ever.   C.R.<br>Director: Jethro Patalinghug is an award-winning filmmaker, video producer, and editor based in San Francisco.

When his brother, Yoni, was killed in the Israeli raid on Entebbe in 1976, Bibi made studying and defeating terrorism his life s mission. His knowledge and camera-ready personality won him favor in American political circles and the media, elements he quickly learned to influence. At the age of 35, he was appointed Israel s ambassador to the U.N., before finally becoming the Prime Minister of Israel and a powerful world leader. KING BIBI is an unsparing and unsettling documentary charting Netanyahu s controversial and meteoric rise. Whether you regard Netanyahu as hero or villain, this fascinating film has much to teach about world politics, and it will resonate deeply with our own events in the United States. The world order is a marionette manipulated by a handful of individuals. Here is a chance to learn about one who, both deeply loved and passionately hated, has the power to pull the strings.

The class contains a group of intellectually advanced students who, from the start, seem odd to Pierre. They are reviled by other students and seem coldly removed from everything. When their behavior becomes more disturbing, Pierre follows them and finds a cache of videos the children have made horrifying images of tragedies, animal slaughter, and mankind s violent cruelty. These children view the world as doomed. They are using their intellects to isolate and shield themselves from it. And most frightening of all, they seem to be planning something. SCHOOL S OUT builds dread like a slowly boiling pot. Are these students evil? Worse, are they the inevitable product of a world we ve let spin out of control? Will the answers drive Pierre to follow his colleague? It all leads to an unexpected and blood-chilling finale. Class is now terrifyingly in session.

They are all of men, women, and children heading towards odd moments of crisis. We have Ela and Andrzej, on a flight when their talkative neighbor dies in the next seat. And then there is Milosz, a young man living with an animal-hoarding mother. His online gaming feud frighteningly spills into real life while he works at a huge wedding (the event itself about to collapse with a missing groom and an hysterical new bride). PANIC ATTACK is a masterful and original cinematic stew, tossing characters into its wickedly observant broth. The ingredients are stirred with brilliantly judged timing as the heat slowly and steadily increases. We soon begin to see how these seemingly random tales begin to connect in startling ways. Subtly seasoned with rich, dark humor and served by a superb cast, PANIC ATTACK is tense, clever, and moving. Keep calm and grip your seat.

Bush addressed it in a speech in 2004. While many assumed doping was dead,  doctor  Tony Bosch did not. The quirky Miami native, who earned his physician s degree in Belize because medical school was too hard in America, concocted a harebrained plan to skirt Major League Baseball s strict drug testing policy. Using an anti-aging clinic as a front, Bosch who was not licensed to practice in the States began prescribing regimens of untraceable microdoses. One of his early clients was Manny Ramirez, whose success with Bosch piqued the interest of Alex Rodriguez. And that s where things got crazy. You ve probably heard about A-Rod s charades in the news, but do you know the whole story? Told by Bosch and his ex-sidekick, Porter Fischer (with reenactments ingeniously performed by children), SCREWBALL is more true-crime dramedy than sports documentary. Fischer and Bosch are essentially the real life versions of the burglars in  Home Alone  not remotely bright, but incredibly hilarious and entertaining in retelling the story of one of baseball s biggest scandals.  E.F.<br>Director: Billy Corben was born in Fort Myers, Florida. He studied political science, screenwriting, and theatre at the University of Miami.</p></div></a>

They were all created by Chicago advertising firms. In fact, most of the advertising techniques we use and reference today come from Chicago, which has always been a city known for its creativity and innovation. Before the invention of the transcontinental jet, Chicago served as the central hub of the entire country. Every train going east to west or north to south had to stop in Chicago. What resulted was a vital center for the exchange of people, goods, and most importantly, ideas. THE CITY THAT SOLD AMERICA is a glorious deep dive into Chicago s rich history and its lasting effects on our world today. In what reads like a love letter to the Windy City, THE CITY THAT SOLD AMERICA is an upbeat and fascinating documentary that history buffs, Chicagophiles, and everyone else will thoroughly enjoy.  G.S.<br>Director: Award-winning filmmaker, Ky Dickens, is best known for her highly-acclaimed documentary work, her emotionally compelling commercial reel, and her endless list of questions.

Mabel Todd, who helped publish (and alter) the posthumous volumes of her poetry, helped craft that image while profiting from being the poet s  advocate.  But Dickinson s poems and letters reveal a much different story. WILD NIGHTS WITH EMILY, with Molly Shannon as Dickinson, tells this tale in an unexpected and gleefully madcap manner as a hilariously droll costume drama. Never crossing into slapstick, this subversive and razor sharp romp explores the ways we shape life s challenges that take us out of our comfort zones. Using copious quotes from Dickinson s poems and letters, WILD NIGHTS WITH EMILY details her lifelong affair with her sister-in-law, Susan. Playing with notions like lovers rubbing toes beneath the table, the real passion and pain of Dickinson s life is never ignored. Instead, the passion becomes a bonfire the film dances and cavorts around with wicked originality and gloriously campy joy. Lit class was never this much fun.  C.R.<br>Director: Madeleine Olnek is a New York City-based playwright and filmmaker. She was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship for her third feature film, WILD NIGHTS WITH EMILY, which premiered at SXSW 2018.

While the father and son enjoy running errands and going for walks in the park, most of Sami s spare time these days is spent studying for his upcoming baccalaureate exam.

But just a few days before the exam, Riadh and his wife find their son s bedroom empty, and Sami is nowhere to be found. He has taken his belongings and eventually sends word that he has gone to Syria to join the jihadists.

Her father (Emile Hirsch) forbids it, telling her bad people want to kill them and they must stay hidden. One day Chloe defies dad, going outside for ice cream from a Mr. Snow-Cone truck. Mr. Snow-Cone (Bruce Dern) knows things about Chloe and shows her a world that may be just as insane as dad says. Billboards warn of  abnormals  and the news tells of children destroying Dallas. Does the strange Mr. Snow-Cone have the answers or is he a new danger? FREAKS is the cinematic equivalent of having a hand-mixer plunged into your brain and turned on high. This fiendishly crafted genre salad is an unsettling and pulse-pounding experience. Mixing dark political parable and apocalyptic sci-fi, it upends every expectation. Sometimes grim and violent, the film s most subversive maneuver is making these crazed events uncomfortably familiar while being genuinely touching. At its core, FREAKS is a story about what any family,  normal  or otherwise, will do to protect themselves and survive.  C.R.<br>Director: Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein met 11 years ago as competitors on On The Lot, Steven Spielbergs reality show that searched for up-and-coming filmmakers. The duo made a new short film every week and lived together for a summer, sequestered in a bungalow on a studio lot in Los Angeles. Over the years, Lipovsky and Stein have directed digital and TV projects, most recently the live-action version of Disneys Kim Possible.</p></div></a>

We prove something by building it up.  It s a 50-year-old quote of profound wisdom that is still needed now, perhaps more than ever. Beyond his transformative role at the college and as a devout Catholic priest, Hesburgh was also an extremely powerful bi-partisan force in American politics. He advised several presidents and foreign leaders and, as a member of the Civil Rights Commission, was an architect of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He had friends on all sides of the religious and political aisles. Those friendships were often tested, though, as Hesburgh s allegiance wasn t to any one particular person or group, but to the greater good. On many occasions, he found himself at odds with his church and government. As the record shows, his strong moral compass always guided him to the right side of history. HESBURGH is a fiercely inspiring documentary about a priest who set out to change a university but ended up changing the world.  E.F.<br>Director: Patrick Creadon is a 1989 graduate of the University of Notre Dame and received his masters degree in cinematography from the American Film Institute (1996).</p></div></a>

The gorgeous teenager is engaged to handsome Rafa and dreams of being a hairdresser. Yet her world is upended after she meets moody fellow gypsy, Lola, a 16-year-old aspiring teacher and clandestine graffiti artist who is secretly a lesbian. The two girls form a friendship that blooms into a tender romance, which complicates Carmen s wedding plans and goes against their strict, religious Roma culture. When the pair s relationship comes to light, the tension between old-fashioned gender and romantic stereotypes, and Lola and Carmen s more holistic modern view of love, boils over. CARMEN   LOLA is a realistic and sensitive portrayal of two teenagers discovering the ecstasy of connection for the first time. However, it s also a smart commentary on the pernicious nature of discrimination and how narrow-minded worldviews are often masking fear and ignorance.

Fast forward ten years and the two are close friends, wowing the community with their basketball skills. One night after a game, Ramzi is shot and killed for no reason, a not-so-uncommon occurrence given the hostile environment in Palestine. Ziad and his friends are filled with anger and engage in an act of revenge that leads to a police chase. Authorities only manage to catch Ziad, and he refuses to snitch on his buddies. He spends 15 years in an Israeli prison, where he s tortured and mistreated. When he s finally released, he s given a hero s welcome in his hometown, but readjusting to life on the outside proves challenging. While the technology to communicate is now more convenient than ever, he finds it impossible to truly connect with anyone; he s still isolated, regardless of whether or not he s behind bars. This compelling character drama shines a light on the difficulties of reintegration.

The film travels the globe seeking understanding of impoverished communities and their progress or stagnation as a result of capitalism, socialistic ideals, and state-run welfare systems. While many immigrants to the United States and newly independent nations sought freedom from socialist governments to benefit from capitalism, the present-day political climate complicates both economies, leaving plenty of room for healthy discussion. Brooks visits the bustling streets of Mumbai, a once-thriving coal mining town in Kentucky, the presumably happiest nation of Denmark, a street rally in Barcelona, Spain, and an Indian monastery for a truly global view on these topics. Rather than embracing a definitive political stance, THE PURSUIT offers an opportunity for genuine conversation about individuals  opinions, experiences, and views of the best ways we can all support each other regardless of class or social status in our pursuit of happiness.  A.B.<br>Director: John Papola is a filmmaker, entrepreneur, and co-founder of Emergent Order, a creative studio based in Austin, Texas. An economics autodidact, Papola is known in education and financial circles as the co-creator of numerous digital properties bringing economics to millions of viewers.

Fifteen-year-old Magnea, an otherwise good student with a supportive, stable homelife, dabbles in temptation and finds herself enamored of older, mischievous Stella. Overshadowed by Stella s persuasive influence of crime, partying, and a growing drug addiction, their friendship and budding romance fall victim to how they ll get their next fix. Fast forward a few decades and the once-inseparable pair, though permanently linked, have followed very different paths. The out-of-sequence arrangement of LET ME FALL exposes snapshots of each woman s life from adolescence through adulthood. Slowly revealing the twisted details of how they ve led each other to the present day, the women s dark, gritty pasts will inevitably determine their uncertain futures. Based on true events, the film visits the horrific places of an addict s rock bottom, illustrates the heartbreaking impacts on an addict s family, and divulges the ceaseless struggle one faces when trying to outlive their demons.

They also are capable of crafting tools to commit atrocities and to destroy. And these same hands create the means of documenting these acts. This paradox lies at the heart of Jean-Luc Godard s avant-garde cinematic poem/essay/polemic. With no featured actors and only Godard s voice providing comment, THE IMAGE BOOK is a complex and unsettling assembly of film clips from classic world cinema, horrific news footage of war violence, and still images. Many are visually and aurally altered, forcing us to re-examine the familiar and consider it in the light of Godard s narrative. It is a film that confronts its audience, forcing them to react in ways that conventional narrative may not. It is meant to disturb, to be an overwhelming audio-visual experience. Godard rejects the idea of a passive audience and has thrown down a gauntlet. Film lovers willing to take his challenge are in for a truly unique encounter with one of cinema s most revered provocateurs. (In English, French, Arabic, Italian, and German with subtitles)  C.R.<br>Director: Jean-Luc Godard was born in Paris, France. His film career has spanned nearly seven decades. More than half of Godard's 43 feature films had their American premieres at the New York Film Festival in Manhattan, and in October 2013 the Festival featured a comprehensive retrospective of his work. Godard was voted one of the greatest directors of all time by Entertainment Weekly.</p></div></a>

For various reasons, the project never went forward. After Jeanne-Claude s death in 2009, Christo decided to make their project a reality. He would craft a massive floating segmented bridge, covered in golden fabric, across Lake Iseo in Italy. For 16 days, people would connect profoundly with nature and have the experience of WALKING ON WATER. This documentary does far more than detail the intense mechanics and political maneuvering of bringing Christo s vision into being. It is an unfiltered look into the soul of an artist whose passions are as elemental as the waters and weather that constantly challenge the project. As the opening day approaches, issues of crowd control, brutal storms, and inept politicians begin to pale next to the volcanic force that is Christo. WALKING ON WATER brilliantly captures this amazing creative feat and the extraordinary creative mind behind it.

She was not a rule-follower. From a nanny on Park Avenue to writing copy, Kael backed into film reviewing and criticism. She admitted she  could live without movies before she could live without books,  yet she became one of the most revered (and despised) forces in movies. After becoming the film critic for The New Yorker, Kael cemented her controversial influence, aggressively challenging the role of film criticism and even altering the course of cinema. She was a West Coast renegade assaulting the citadel of male New York critics. They hated her. She, in turn, hated academic reviewers and  unassailable  film classics, gleefully tossing verbal acid in the industry s face. Rich in film clips and testimonials, with Sarah Jessica Parker as the voice of Pauline Kael, WHAT SHE SAID: THE ART OF PAULINE KAEL is a documentary as unsparing as Kael, in which she is adored as heroine and condemned as villain. She d have loved the villain bits.  C.R.<br>Director: New York-based filmmaker Rob Garver graduated from Northwestern University. He has written, produced, and directed several short films that have been screened in local New York cinemas and aired on cable television.</p></div></a>
