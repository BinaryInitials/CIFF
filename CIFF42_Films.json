A poor repairman with a failing shop, Khuddoos has placed cameras around his house and closely monitors everything. When he suspects a neighbor is beating his young boy, Khuddoos becomes obsessed with finding the identity of the child and helping him. The boy, the son of a local butcher, is also isolated from his family and his world. He, too, spies on people through windows and from rooftops. As Khuddoos  search for the boy becomes more frantic, his antagonistic relations with his neighbors and his tenuous grip on reality further decay. These are people living IN THE SHADOWS.

Her mother was so upset about her daughter s artistic inclinations she often destroyed her work. Kusama eventually moved to America to pursue her dreams, despite having no connections and speaking limited English. Undeterred, she worked her way into the New York pop-art scene and became famous in the 60 s with press attention comparable to Andy Warhol s. Kusama fought racism and sexism in the industry, often finding herself at odds with other artists. But she never backed down or changed for anyone. One of her biggest challenges has been her own mental illness. Hallucinations of polka dots (which inspired much of her incredible conceptual art) were partly responsible for her move to a mental institution in Tokyo, where she s lived for the last 30 years. Kusama remains prolific today, still a world-renowned and respected artist in her 80s.

But you may be unaware of the horrors documented in DAWNLAND. For much of the 20th century, social workers stole Native American children from their homes and placed them with white families. The reasons for their removal were often unfounded; some were the result of cultural differences that non-Native Americans didn t understand. More troubling is this practice seemed to be part of a systematic move to distance the children from their heritage and erase their culture. They were given new names and forced to act, dress, and talk like white Americans. These methods were an effort to once again wipe Native Americans from our history. DAWNLAND focuses on the recent formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission by the Wabanaki tribes and the state of Maine that aims to help those affected by this atrocity.

The town s close-knit community prepares to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Bisbee s darkest hour: the infamous Bisbee Deportation of 1917, during which 1,200 striking miners were violently taken from their homes, banished to the middle of the desert, and left to die. Townspeople confront this violent, misunderstood past by staging dramatic recreations of the escalating strike. These dramatized scenes are based on subjective versions of the story and  directed,  in a sense, by residents with conflicting views of the event. Deeply personal segments torn from family history build toward a massive restaging of the deportation itself on the exact day of its 100th anniversary. In BISBEE  17, filmmaker Robert Greene confronts the current political predicaments of immigration, unionization, environmental damage, and corporate corruption with direct, haunting messages about solidarity and struggle. With consummate skill and his signature penchant for bending the boundaries of documentary, Greene artfully stirs up the ghosts of our past as a cautionary tale that speaks to our present.

With loving and supportive parents who fought to keep them from being segregated in school, they are hardworking and leading productive lives with bright futures ahead of them.

The women she finds including bloggers, a professional gamer, a video game programmer, and an aerospace engineer provide thoughtful insights into their passion for anime, comics, gaming, and sci-fi. GEEK GIRLS illustrates how the outsider-welcoming veneer of this booming nerd culture masks issues with harassment, cyberbullying, and misogyny. Some women hide their cosplaying (a term used to describe dressing up as favorite fictional characters) from family and co-workers, while others are circumspect about where they live for safety reasons. Still, the documentary balances these sobering moments with touching stories in which women share how partaking in nerd-leaning activities helped them overcome grief and depression, or pointed them to fulfilling career paths.

It s raking in billions, and while locals don t see the bulk of that money, most of them are happy with the income it brings in. That s mainly because, before the palm oil boom, they were struggling to make ends meet in the declining rubber industry. But as the title of this documentary points out, the topic is extremely complex. Much of the region sits on peat, a dense, carbon-heavy substance made of organic matter and dead vegetation. In order to clear land for palm oil crops, many companies and farmers resort to the inexpensive option of setting fires. This method is extremely bad for the environment, contributing to a high percentage of carbon emissions. Because peatlands are dry and flammable, these fires spread quickly and are only contained by heavy rains.

Today his dad (Tate Donovan) is an anti-horror film crusader. He is targeting a local extravaganza called Blood Fest, which promises blood, more blood, and gratuitous slaughter. This heavily walled-in event recreates locations from gore classics, providing acres of interactive terror. Even though dad forbids it, Dax loves horror and plans to attend. The evil event organizer has plans, however. Once the festival starts and gates are locked, the horror begins for real, and it is all being filmed. But Dax knows all the rules of horror films, which he and his friends will need to survive. BLOOD FEST is a witty commentary on horror cinema as well as a non-stop gore-opera. This has everything: sly spoofs of classic horror scenes, zombies, chainsaw massacres, killer clowns, and jokes faster than an arterial spurt. Also, as promised, blood, more blood, and gratuitous slaughter. You ll scream (and laugh) your head off, if it isn t torn from you.

The year is 2095. A catastrophic rise in both sea and sodium levels has resulted in massive species extinctions, and humanity s outlook is bleak. Time travel, however, has been achieved. A person is split in two and one is sent back in time while the other maintains control in the present. Fang Rung is now that split person, or QEDA. He is also the head of the Agency that has banned time travel as treason. In 2017, a scientist was developing a protein that would have averted the global crisis. But before completing it, she died in a plane crash. Fang Rung now sends his QEDA back to our time to retrieve this formula while being hunted for time treason in 2095.

Over the course of two years, Terki captures Osama s daily life, focusing his camera mainly on the relationship between Osama and his young sons, who he is raising to be jihadists. The children spend their time playing war in destroyed tanks and minefields, with the almost constant sound of explosions in the distance. As they learn violence, hatred, and discipline from Osama, the boys strive to please him at all costs. Deeply unsettling, the film s observational approach captures the gradual loss of innocence as the boys grow and prepare to follow in their father s footsteps. OF FATHERS AND SONS is an incredibly brave documentary that provides rare insight into the personal lives and relationships of Islamic fundamentalists. Perhaps the most shocking revelation of all is the genuine love Osama has for his children, despite the path he has chosen for them.

A poor boy from the country, he carved his own path and rose to unprecedented fame faster than anyone had before. More than 40 years after his death, Elvis is still known around the world as  The King.  But even this perceived immortality could not prevent the tragedy that befell him.

The  Great Escape,  as it came to be known to Irish Republicans, was the biggest European prison break since World War II. And it was a huge morale booster for the IRA, which had recently suffered a great loss. Inspired by these infamous events, MAZE blends historical accuracy with a compelling and suspenseful plot. The film s central relationship is between Larry Marley, an IRA prisoner who conceives the plan, and Gordon Close, a prison guard who is tricked into trusting Marley, as the steps for the prison break are put into place right under his nose. Though Marley originally earns Close s confidence strategically, a genuine mutual bond of respect is created between the two men. Complex and powerful, MAZE is both a crime thriller and an intimate story of a profoundly painful period in the history of Northern Ireland.

The first part of QUALITY TIME is the story of Koen and his disinterest in chugging ham and milk at a family gathering which he does at his family s urging, only to become sick. Next is Stefaan, who has moved back home with his parents and visits locations from his life so he can take photos of these monumental sites. Kjell travels back in time to try and fix his insecurities with a rather brilliant plan involving a medieval fantasy tour. QUALITY TIME ends with a quick tour of an alien abduction before moving to the final and longest of the tales when we watch Jef work rather hard and incompetently to impress his girlfriend s family. Bakker has mastered inventive storytelling, with each of the stories utilizing different mechanics and form. And even as the characters are searching for charm, QUALITY TIME is all charm and more.

Lonely, yet free-spirited and lively, Paula bounces between friends  couches, dance parties, and temporary jobs, meeting a variety of people along the way.

This gripping documentary follows Siakor as he and fellow activists document illegal logging operations and work tirelessly to chip away at the rampant corruption undermining political progress. In some of the film s most touching moments, SILAS also examines the toll this activism takes on Siakor s health and family life. And the film reveals the sobering differences between Liberia s international perception and what s actually happening in individual communities. Throughout the film, Siakor s resilience in the face of criticism and obstruction, as well as his selfless commitment to making Liberia a better place, are profoundly inspiring.

With a lens that captures the beauty of intimate architectural detail and a mind that probes details of political and social upheaval, Mila starts a fascinating and personal investigation. As a professor of mathematics and a champion of her politically active students, Mila s mother became a nationally known opponent of Slobodan Milo evic  and a champion of liberty.

After he caught the attention of an advertising agency, the creative directors formed a campaign around Amir and his virtual persona. Looking to market their product as edgy and dangerous, they positioned Amir to become the new face of a well-known energy drink before things started to fall apart. DRIB is a meta-cinematic recreation of these bizarre yet true events, with Amir playing himself. A mix of interviews, reenactments, and creative control issues between Amir and the film s director, DRIB is a hilarious satire that deconstructs corporate culture and advertising. To avoid a lawsuit, the filmmakers created their own energy drink  DRIB  to stand in place of the real brand.

The decaying urban landscape became a canvas as art fled from the galleries and took to the streets. Living on those streets was the young Jean-Michel Basquiat, absorbing the energy and chaos of the times. Bringing himself to notice with stunning graffiti, Basquiat insinuated himself into every art and with every artist he could. BOOM FOR REAL is the story of the early years of a revolutionary gadfly, buzzing about the art world, challenging norms and shattering barriers. Told in a kaleidoscopic whirl of images and interviews, BOOM FOR REAL is the scrapbook of a tectonic shift in the nature and purposes of art. This is the New York City of Club 57 and the Mud Club, a time of unfettered experimentation, drugs, and genre-blending that changed everything to come.

Afflicted with gigantism, Joaquin is nearly eight feet tall, and still growing. Crippled in the war and unable to work the farm, Martin seizes on a scheme to exploit his brother s freakish size and earn enough to help his family. Joaquin reluctantly agrees, despising the stares and laughter, while wanting to save their farm. Now begins a grueling sideshow journey across 19th century Europe, with the leering eyes of the world upon them. As the fame of the giant grows across the nations, so too does Joaquin physically and emotionally as he becomes less willing to be ridiculed and displayed. Based on the true story of Miguel Joaquin Eleizegui Arteaga, better known as the  Giant from Altzo,  HANDIA is a gorgeous evocation of a time not that different from today. Though a tale of sibling rivalry, human fear, and ignorance, the film never fails in its compassion towards those who are outcast and exploited.

It doesn t help when your parents are swingers who host parties where their naked friends parade around the house. STAR BOYS takes place in a small, conservative town in Finland where a sexual revolution has just begun. The story is told through the perspective of two 12-year-old boys whose parents are unashamedly open about their newfound sexual liberation. They seem oblivious to the effect it s having on their sons. The kinky behavior commonly happens out in the open, leaving to some very awkward and traumatizing moments for the kids. As time goes by, the open relationship concept starts to sour for some of the adults, causing friction in their marriages. All the fighting and drama has pushed the boys over the line. A backlash is coming. At times, STAR BOYS is dark and unsettling. The young actors do an excellent job conveying the heavy gnarled emotions of their fragile characters. You genuinely feel that weight. But at the same time, there s also hope and redemption in the resilience they display despite the disturbing circumstances.
