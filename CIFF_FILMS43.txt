THE STORY OF CREEM MAGAZINE chronicles what some consider to be the greatest rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll magazine ever made (with an iconic mascot designed by cartoonist, Robert Crumb). In this compelling film, Alice Cooper, Cameron Crowe, Michael Stipe, Chad Smith, Joan Jett, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Kirk Hammett, and Wayne Kramer express their love and appreciation for Creem. Started in Detroit in 1969 by Barry Kramer, the magazine aimed to be the anti-Rolling Stone. Instead of covering artists in New York and Los Angeles, Creem was devoted to the sounds of the Midwest, particularly the booming scene in its hometown. They were the first to feature such bands as The MC5, The Stooges, and Parliament Funkadelic. But they weren&rsquo;t just known for their work; the motley crew of a staff lived the rockstar lifestyle themselves, with their headquarters being a destination for debauchery. As their popularity rose, internal problems emerged between Kramer and notorious editor, Lester Bangs, causing chaos behind the scenes. Sadly, both died of drug overdoses in the early 80s. Director Scott Crawford uncovers the ups and downs of one of music&rsquo;s biggest influencers in this entertaining rockumentary. , biography=null, locations=[USA], schedule=[Friday March 29 2019 at 8:50 PM, Saturday March 30 2019 at 1:20 PM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

Its popularity grew, and in the 1960s charismatic professional golfers such as Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer expanded its audience. Today, Tiger Woods and other players are full-blown celebrities. But what about the mysterious people carrying their bags around the golf course? In LOOPERS: THE CADDIE&rsquo;S LONG WALK, director Jason Baffa shifts the spotlight to these individuals. At one time, the prevailing expectation for caddies was this: show up, keep up, and shut up. However, this inspiring documentary paints a different picture of these essential, unsung heroes, who often act as advisors, counselors, and confidants. The job has become so vital to victory there are training programs to teach these skills. The film highlights one at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, led by renowned caddie master, Mike Kiely. Narrated by comedy legend (and former caddie) Bill Murray, LOOPERS is fun and light-hearted, using humor and charm to finally give caddies their day in the sun. , biography=null, locations=[USA], schedule=[Thursday April 04 2019 at 5:20 PM, Friday April 05 2019 at 1:55 PM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

Welcome to the brace-wearing, golf-cart driving, pastel insanity of a suburbia that could only exist in a subdivision of hell. How black is the outrageous humor of GREENER GRASS? Close your eyes and plunge your head into a bottle of ink. Eschewing all decorum and boundaries, this insanely funny satire shreds marriage, children, school, television, family photos, and pretty much everything else America holds sacred. Played with deadpan brilliance by an awesome cast, GREENER GRASS grows more inappropriate, unhinged, and surreal by the frame. Assuming the mantle of John Waters, these filmmakers invert decency so often that laughing is all you can do. Most subversively, the more deliciously deranged the film becomes, the more uncomfortably familiar it seems.

Activist Cleveland Sellers was one of the survivors of this tragedy and the only person to be convicted and jailed in the aftermath of what came to be known as the Orangeburg Massacre. Fifty years later, Cleveland&rsquo;s son, Bakari Sellers, continues the fight for equality. As a child of the Civil Rights Movement, Sellers stands for the same ideals his father did, and he uses his family&rsquo;s history as inspiration to campaign for change. WHILE I BREATHE, I HOPE follows this young black democratic candidate on his race for lieutenant governor of South Carolina.

Thirty-six years after its founding in 1982, ripples from West Hollywood Aquatics are still being felt across the social pond. Started by and for gay swimmers banned from their teams and forbidden to compete, the gay-only swim club took root alongside the first Gay Games held the same year. West Hollywood Aquatics registered as the first openly gay masters swim and water polo club. They formed a team and began training and sending athletes to the Games and swim meets, winning medals and setting world records along the way. Narrated by original members and featuring wonderful historic footage, LIGHT IN THE WATER is a documentary that puts your heart on jetskis. These brave and talented fish-out-of-water did more than shatter images of a &ldquo;weak&rdquo; community. They became warriors in the AIDS crisis and a vital force in the gay rights movement.

Fronted by singer/multi-instrumentalist Tim Taylor, the indie rock outfit was ahead of its time musically, lyrically, and sonically. Taylor came from a jazz background and, as those in the film affirm, he could play anything. While their songs maintained a level of pop sensibility, their quirky frontman&rsquo;s penchant for experimentation made them wholly unique. After touring with The Jesus Lizard, Girls Against Boys, and Beck, they found themselves at the center of a major label bidding war. But a week before signing a contract, Taylor died in a tragic car accident. BRAINIAC: TRANSMISSIONS AFTER ZERO highlights the incredible impact Taylor and his bandmates had on the world of alternative music. It features ardent interviews with members of such bands as Nine Inch Nails, Melvins, Mars Volta, The National, and Hole, all of whom were greatly inspired by Brainiac. Though their time together was unfortunately brief, this absorbing documentary helps to ensure Brainiac&rsquo;s ingenious music will live on. , biography=null, locations=[USA], schedule=[Thursday March 28 2019 at 9:10 PM, Friday March 29 2019 at 4:20 PM, Saturday March 30 2019 at 9:00 AM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

It centers around Pakete, an 11-year-old soccer player on the Soto Alto school team, who has become a YouTube sensation for his painfully bad penalty shots. Because the team faces a demotion in league status, the school is considering ending the soccer program. In fact, they must win the next three games or the team is toast. For many of the players, this decision would have a ripple effect of consequences. To boost their chances of winning, the team&rsquo;s coaches add an extremely talented player named Helena to the roster. But something weird starts happening at their matches: the referees keep falling asleep, prompting a seemingly biased substitute to take over. Is this a coincidence or a conspiracy? To get to the bottom of things, the curious athletes become detectives, doing anything they can to save their team. THE FOOTBALLEST is an absolute blast, blending comedy, mystery, adventure, and puppy love into one highly entertaining package the whole family can enjoy.

However, Morrison&rsquo;s climb to preeminence was not an easy one. and recognition from the literary establishment was slow to arrive. Her life began on the racially integrated streets of Lorain, Ohio in a home with parents who strongly encouraged her interest in reading and education. But it was quite a culture shock when she experienced institutionalized segregation as a Howard University student when off-campus in Washington, DC. Morrison subsequently held a series of teaching positions before landing a L.W. Singer editing role, which changed the trajectory of her life. Her work led her to become the first black woman senior fiction editor for Random House. Morrison&rsquo;s instinctive influence helped bring black fiction authors into the mainstream while encouraging autobiographies by activists such as Angela Davis and Mohammed Ali. Meanwhile, she began writing her own work and published The Bluest Eye (1970), Sula (1973), Son of Solomon (1977), and Tar Baby (1981) with a focus on inspiring an African American audience. Broad acclaim did not arrive as quickly, and there was an outcry by dozens of black critics and writers after her 1987 epic novel, Beloved, failed to win major book awards. But many factors, including that protest and ongoing praise and engagement of Morrison&rsquo;s work from such people as Oprah Winfrey, steered her to the universal praise she always deserved.

But the reality of what was waiting for them was an entirely different story. Violence, cruelty, and a terrifying lack of humanity would cause unimaginable suffering and loss. Those who survived would endure some of the worst treatment. Based on real events, SOBIBOR portrays the horrific atrocities that took place within one of the largest extermination camps in Poland, as well as the infamous uprising that followed, in which 600 prisoners made a massive escape attempt, killing 11 SS officers in the process. The revolt was led by Soviet officer Alexander Pechersky, who was being held in Sobibor as a prisoner of war. Although any acts of defiance were met with severe and often lethal punishments, enough resilience and hope remained to carry out an impossible plan.

It may sound like the plot of some exploitation film, but it&rsquo;s actually a summary of BREAKING HABITS, an explosive documentary directed by Robert Ryan. The story follows Christine Meeusen, a divorced former corporate executive who turns to growing and selling cannabis after discovering her husband was a bigamist and a thief. Meeusen&rsquo;s business in Merced, California isn&rsquo;t just some shady operation, though; the marijuana they distribute is for medicinal use only. Seeing medical marijuana as a way to heal the sick, Meeusen adopted the persona of &ldquo;Sister Kate,&rdquo; and, fittingly, her company was coined Sisters of the Valley. Neither she nor any of the other nuns in the group are affiliated with a particular religious order, but the service they provide certainly feels like a miracle to those who need it. Unfortunately for the sisters, not everyone is pleased with their mission. Whether battling state regulators or protecting their crops from the cartels (hence the aforementioned guns), these rebel sisters remain tough as nails. Ryan&rsquo;s film is wild and fun, but also indispensable in its examination of the fast-changing marijuana industry. , biography=null, locations=[UNITED KINGDOM,  USA], schedule=[Saturday March 30 2019 at 7:05 PM, Sunday March 31 2019 at 11:25 AM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

With his passion for democratic ideals, Pulitzer fought for the free press and essentially created the news as we know it today.

She climbs trees, runs barefoot, and hangs out with boys instead of girls&hellip; something that often gets her scolded by neighbors and elders. Unconcerned with her reputation, Dhunu continues to meet her friends each day after school. Together, they create fake instruments out of styrofoam and form their very own fantasy rock band. After seeing a comic strip portraying kids in a band with real instruments, Dhunu begins to dream of ditching the fantasy band to form a real band and starts working to save money for a guitar. But growing up in poverty in rural India poses big challenges when trying to assemble a rock band. Despite the obstacles, Dhunu forges ahead with optimism and resilience. Capturing the sweet innocence of childhood dreams, VILLAGE ROCKSTARS follows Dhunu&rsquo;s journey in this tender coming-of-age story. Beautifully immersive, VILLAGE ROCKSTARS creates a world so authentic, it often feels like an observational documentary rather than a narrative film.

Leonard Soloway is bringing a show to Broadway. Admit it. You just thought, &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; We are glad you asked. So is he. Leonard Soloway is an authentic Broadway legend whose career includes over 100 shows, 62 Tony nominations, 40 Tony Awards, and 21 Drama Desk Awards. And he has worked with some of the greatest stars of the stage along the way. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Soloway started his career at the Cleveland Play House. After moving to New York, he landed a few acting bits before finding his niche as a general manager and producer. Outspoken, humorous, and openly gay long before it was acceptable, Soloway became a force in the Broadway world with his dedication and boundless energy. LEONARD SOLOWAY&rsquo;S BROADWAY is a warm and friendly documentary that (wisely) stands aside and lets this disarming gentleman tell his own story in his own way.

Thankfully, the city also has an abundance of generous people who want to give these furry creatures better (and safer) lives.

And sensitive activist Claire, the co-founder of nonprofit Brooklyn Animal Action, has devoted nine years of her life to rescues. Yet the beauty of THE CAT RESCUERS is how much the felines also help their saviors.

It follows a small-time Kenyan ivory dealer known simply as X, whose missions to procure elephant tusks have become increasingly difficult as police ramp up protective measures for wildlife. The mood of the people has changed too. Marches and parades in favor of stricter laws against poaching are more and more common. X&rsquo;s partner, Lukas, is the one who actually does the dirty deed, as X is uncomfortable with killing animals, despite the obvious irony in his choice of work. But for these men, selling ivory is a means to support their families. Environmental and ethical issues presented are weighed against the economic benefits. The film also follows Asan, a wildlife ranger who just happens to be X&rsquo;s cousin. The glaring conflict of interest creates discernable tension between them.

Godard rejects the idea of a passive audience and has thrown down a gauntlet. Film lovers willing to take his challenge are in for a truly unique encounter with one of cinema&rsquo;s most revered provocateurs.

The city&rsquo;s homeless population regularly seeks refuge from the elements at the downtown public library, patiently awaiting the doors to open each morning after spending long nights in a shelter or risking their lives out on the street. Stuart Goodson (Emilio Estevez) and his fellow librarians empathize with their patrons, but they walk a fine line to honor the rights of the homeless individuals while respecting other patrons&rsquo; rights to a safe, comfortable library visit. With overflow shelters at capacity on the coldest night of the year, nearly 100 homeless men, several of whom experience mental illness, hold a peaceful protest in the library, insisting on staying the night to keep warm. The police threaten the use of force to evacuate the patrons, while the media has its own intentions of reporting a version of the story for the sake of ratings instead of the truth. Caught on the frontlines, Stuart, who must choose to succumb to pressures to stand down or immerse himself in the movement. Timely, socially relevant, and altogether captivating, THE PUBLIC offers brutally honest portrayals of homelessness, addiction, and mental illness along with our willingness &ndash; or the resistance &ndash; to help our neighbors in need. &ndash; A.B., biography=null, locations=[USA], schedule=[Sunday April 07 2019 at 6:45 PM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

With 45 seconds left, Pacer Ron Artest, already notorious for his volcanic temper, sparked an altercation that soon erupted into the stands and became the most shameful and violent incident in NBA history. QUIET STORM is the story of Ron Artest (aka Metta World Peace). Where most documentaries focus on a familiar arc of struggle and triumph, this film dares to go deeper. Beginning with Artest&rsquo;s childhood in New York&rsquo;s infamous Queensbridge projects, the film charts his development as a man and a basketball player. It also documents the rise of New York&rsquo;s crack epidemic and the vicious street culture that gripped the city. Artest not only needed to survive his neighborhood, but he also had to deal with a personal and family history of mental illness. Fearless and honest in its handling of difficult themes, QUIET STORM is presented with narrative force and the energy of a playoff game. It is a story you may have heard, but never like this. , biography=null, locations=[USA], schedule=[Friday March 29 2019 at 1:50 PM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=[African Diaspora, The Sports Section], premier=false, premierDescription=null]

This time around, they are pointing the camera at factory farming and the toll it&rsquo;s had on our country&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens. They take on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (a.k.a. CAFOs), which are notorious for producing large amounts of untreated waste. Neighbors of these facilities have been subjected to a myriad of health issues, stemming from the harmful conditions there. This documentary chronicles the plight of five communities dealing with these extremely unfortunate circumstances. Their needs aren&rsquo;t much; they&rsquo;re basic necessities many of us take for granted, such as clean air and water. The lack of regulation and oversight into the offending companies is certainly discouraging. But instead of being apathetic, these brave citizens have decided to rise up and rally against the corporate behemoths who ignore their calls for change. It&rsquo;s challenging to see the harm that&rsquo;s been inflicted on them, but their inspiring resilience is beautifully captured in this exceptionally compelling film. , biography=null, locations=[USA], schedule=[Thursday April 04 2019 at 4:50 PM, <ul><li>with <a href="festival/special-programs/filmforums" title="FilmForum">FilmForum</a></li></ul><p>Saturday April 06 2019 at 11:20 AM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

For various reasons, the project never went forward. After Jeanne-Claude&rsquo;s death in 2009, Christo decided to make their project a reality. He would craft a massive floating segmented bridge, covered in golden fabric, across Lake Iseo in Italy. For 16 days, people would connect profoundly with nature and have the experience of WALKING ON WATER. This documentary does far more than detail the intense mechanics and political maneuvering of bringing Christo&rsquo;s vision into being. It is an unfiltered look into the soul of an artist whose passions are as elemental as the waters and weather that constantly challenge the project. As the opening day approaches, issues of crowd control, brutal storms, and inept politicians begin to pale next to the volcanic force that is Christo. WALKING ON WATER brilliantly captures this amazing creative feat and the extraordinary creative mind behind it.

He then goes out drinking to drown his sorrows and ends up getting arrested for drunk driving. The judge has a clever punishment for him: coach basketball at a center for individuals with mental disabilities. The idea doesn&rsquo;t sit well with Marco, whose insolent attitude toward the disabled is somewhat alarming. Still, he&rsquo;s assigned to the Los Amigos organization, and when he arrives to begin coaching, it&rsquo;s clear he has his work cut out for him. These guys aren&rsquo;t just bad at basketball; most of them don&rsquo;t even understand the rules. So Marco has to start completely from scratch. Eventually a semblance of a team begins to take shape. But as their relationships develop, the question becomes: who&rsquo;s teaching whom? While he&rsquo;s transforming these underdogs into formidable athletes, they&rsquo;re actually making him a better person.

Fuguain found a corpse outside his apartment complex and is considered the prime suspect. When Buron is briefly called away, he appoints his one-eyed assistant, Phillipe, to guard the suspect.

Unflinchingly staring mortality in the face, this group of men and women are mostly too busy living to be bothered much about dying. There are elaborate Broadway-style shows to produce, golf to play, sex to be had, and hobbies to pursue. There is even a senior punk band named One Foot In The Grave, whose members perform their hit, Menopause, for you. In short, this is the stuff of life.

Dr. Lang spends his days empathizing with his patients as they deal with grief, the imminent death of loved ones, relationship issues, and struggles with self-worth. Many lean on him to make sense of their lives, including his ex-wife, an unexpected new love interest, and a seasoned undertaker with whom he shares the daily challenge of shouldering other people&rsquo;s troubles for a living. But Dr. Lang, like his patients, daydreams of the connections he longs to make in his own life, masked by his front that he&rsquo;s keeping it all together. While his issues often come second to everyone around him, Dr. Lang must learn to confide in others so he can truly help himself.

She was not a rule-follower. From a nanny on Park Avenue to writing copy, Kael backed into film reviewing and criticism. She admitted she &ldquo;could live without movies before she could live without books,&rdquo; yet she became one of the most revered (and despised) forces in movies. After becoming the film critic for The New Yorker, Kael cemented her controversial influence, aggressively challenging the role of film criticism and even altering the course of cinema. She was a West Coast renegade assaulting the citadel of male New York critics. They hated her.

The documentary travels to Georgia, where controversial reenactments of a 1946 quadruple lynching take place each year, and reenactors include family members of former Ku Klux Klan followers and supporters.

This geological time scale can be read within the stones of the Earth. For the last ten years, a group of scientists has been investigating these epochs, and their evidence suggests we have left the Holocene and entered into a new age, the Anthropocene Epoch. This age is marked by unprecedented human activity&hellip;activity that has changed the Earth and its systems more than all natural processes combined. In her third and final installment in a documentary trilogy exploring humans&rsquo; relationship with the Earth, Jennifer Baichwal travels to nearly every continent to capture this unparalleled epoch and the consequences it carries. Stunning and sobering, ANTHROPOCENE: THE HUMAN EPOCH challenges its viewers to face the dark side of society&rsquo;s industrial and economic progress. Though it may be tempting to look away from the overwhelming enormity of the environmental issues we have created, do yourself and the planet a favor and watch this film. After all, the step to creating change is the willingness to acknowledge the problem.

His full revolutionary impact is revealed in this compelling documentary from Academy Award&reg;-winning director Brigitte Berman. In 1959, Hefner started a television program called Playboy&rsquo;s Penthouse. Set up to look like an apartment party, the variety show featured a slew of legendary performers. But it was its racial diversity that stood out most. Years before MTV was pressured to play black artists, Hefner gave them representation, regardless of the consequences. Despite it being the time of Jim Crow, everyone was treated as equals on Hefner&rsquo;s show, much to the chagrin of some Americans. The program was canceled after two seasons, but reemerged later as Playboy After Dark, which continued to push for equality. In addition to performances from artists such as James Brown, Tina Turner, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Buddy Rich, the show featured candid conversations about censorship, racism, and progressive politics. Going beyond the bunnies, HUGH HEFNER&rsquo;S AFTER DARK: SPEAKING OUT IN AMERICA examines Hefner&rsquo;s unheralded role as civil rights activist. , biography=null, locations=[CANADA], schedule=[Saturday March 30 2019 at 8:30 PM, Sunday March 31 2019 at 11:20 AM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

She&rsquo;s not the only one with secrets, however. As IN THE AISLES progresses, Christian reveals his own burdens and transgressions to his perceptive mentor, Bruno, who turns out to be hiding his own pain.

Her film company, which produces gay porn, is devastated after several of its young actors are brutally murdered. She has broken up with her lover, Lois, who also edits the company&rsquo;s films, and her drinking is escalating. Her disturbing response to these crises is to begin producing porn films that mirror the realities of the killings. Increasingly bizarre occurrences begin swirling about Anne, as does a mysterious black bird that precedes the murders and the appearance of the masked killer. Maybe Anne&rsquo;s life is a film. The line between the celluloid and the certain is becoming terrifyingly blurred. Something unexplainable, perhaps unnatural, is tightening its grip. An ending of B-movie proportions may be facing Anne and everyone around her. KNIFE+HEART plays gleefully and stylishly with the borders of reality, mixing film genres in an erotic and violent brew.

Day in and day out, their skateboarding sessions are interrupted by Football and Chola, two stray dogs who send their balls into the skate pools and bark until one of their human friends retrieve them. As the canine keepers of Los Reyes, Football and Chola spend their days forcing the skaters into games of fetch, lounging in the shade, and barking at vehicles and passersby. A purely observational documentary, LOS REYES uses intimate shots of the harmonious animals, juxtaposed with disquieting voice-over from the gang of troubled teens who also inhabit the park. Astounding in its minimalism and microfocus, LOS REYES is a refreshingly simple documentary that captures the independent lives and big personalities of two Chilean street dogs and the skatepark they call home.

But his reputation as a feared, provocative interviewer was not easily gained. This film navigates Wallace&rsquo;s path through the early, experimental days of television with work on game shows, a string of advertising gigs, and finally programs that featured a groundbreaking interview style with Eleanor Roosevelt, Salvador Dali, and Gloria Swanson. He struggled to be taken seriously in CBS&rsquo;s Walter Cronkite newsroom as he faced personal struggles and insecurities that he worked diligently to conceal. The 1968 offer to serve as a correspondent on a new but untested type of investigative project, 60 Minutes, was a turning point. While the show wasn't an immediate success, stories about Watergate and the Vietnam War helped it gain traction and ultimately become the most-watched news magazine on television. Wallace aggressively interrogated figures such as U.S. Army General William Westmoreland, Iran&rsquo;s Ayatollah Khomeini, and Russia&rsquo;s Vladmir Putin throughout the decades. And he fought his CBS bosses when they shelved his explosive interview with tobacco industry insider, Jeffrey Wigand. All the while, he suffered from depression and finally relented to a question from Morley Safer, sharing a dark secret later in his career.

Murrow, Helen Thomas, and Max Robinson. &ndash; Patrick Shepherd, biography=null, locations=[USA], schedule=[Thursday April 04 2019 at 7:10 PM, Saturday April 06 2019 at 5:10 PM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

Steven K. Bannon is one. Whether you love him as the salvation of our country or loathe him as the agent of its destruction, his influence is undeniable. This documentary follows Bannon from his departure as White House chief strategist in 2017 until the mid-term elections of 2018. Freed from his &ldquo;political shackles,&rdquo; Bannon pushed his &ldquo;economic nationalist&rdquo; message to help Republicans keep control of Congress in the mid-terms, as well as assist nationalist movements in Europe. Here is Bannon, raw and unfiltered, whose worldviews either elate or horrify and who has the skills to articulate them persuasively. THE BRINK does not avoid any controversies and follows Bannon as he faces his critics. Whether you are a soldier in Bannon&rsquo;s war or see his views as corrosive and evil, this fascinating film reveals a man who, for good or ill, is a force on the world stage. , biography=null, locations=[USA], schedule=[Saturday April 06 2019 at 3:20 PM, Sunday April 07 2019 at 7:05 PM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

The gorgeous teenager is engaged to handsome Rafa and dreams of being a hairdresser. Yet her world is upended after she meets moody fellow gypsy, Lola, a 16-year-old aspiring teacher and clandestine graffiti artist who is secretly a lesbian. The two girls form a friendship that blooms into a tender romance, which complicates Carmen&rsquo;s wedding plans and goes against their strict, religious Roma culture. When the pair&rsquo;s relationship comes to light, the tension between old-fashioned gender and romantic stereotypes, and Lola and Carmen&rsquo;s more holistic modern view of love, boils over. CARMEN &amp; LOLA is a realistic and sensitive portrayal of two teenagers discovering the ecstasy of connection for the first time. However, it&rsquo;s also a smart commentary on the pernicious nature of discrimination and how narrow-minded worldviews are often masking fear and ignorance.

Feeling that other styles of jazz were too limiting, some musicians in the 60s began deconstructing typical conventions, trying out irregular tempos, playing strange notes and chord progressions, and improvising to epic proportions. The goal was to use experimentation to defy traditions, making something completely unique and original.

Using nostalgically over-the-top cinematic flourishes, nerve-tweaking electronic music, and old-school shock, this tale of a haunted dress and the horrors it brings to its wearers is fitted with a very twisted and darkly humored script. It skewers consumer and corporate culture with needle-sharp wit while delivering genuine chills. Weaving these elements together smartly, IN FABRIC is carefully tailored to hem the viewer in with laughter and fear.

But when he knocks on the Nazi&rsquo;s door, his 70-year-old son, Georg, who knows little of his father&rsquo;s past, answers. From their first encounter, Ali and Georg couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Besides their obviously dissimilar histories, Ali is timid and stiff, having spent most of his life in a monotonous and predictable fashion, while Georg is relaxed and outgoing, and seems to fully enjoy life. After getting off to a rough start, the two foils decide to travel together across Slovakia, following the notes in Georg&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s letters and retracing his steps during the war. A profound idea, pairing the grown child of a Nazi with the grown child of his victims for a spontaneous road trip, THE INTERPRETER is both powerfully poignant and playfully lighthearted&hellip; much like the characters themselves.

When his brother, Yoni, was killed in the Israeli raid on Entebbe in 1976, Bibi made studying and defeating terrorism his life&rsquo;s mission.

But when a member of his party&rsquo;s inner circle becomes an informant and exposes long-standing corruption and fraud, Lo&acute;pez-Vidal&rsquo;s life comes crashing down. Loyal allies protect their own self-interests and turn their backs on the once-respected leader as he absorbs the brunt of the criminal accusations and loses everything he cherishes, including his wife, Ine&acute;s, and teenage daughter, Nati. As his trial looms and the walls start closing in, Lo&acute;pez-Vidal becomes increasingly desperate to bring the rest of his colleagues down. Yet his reckless behavior illustrates the high cost of both maintaining the status quo and exacting revenge on perceived enemies. THE REALM is a tense, mesmerizing political thriller, illuminating the dangers of mixing excessive hubris with unchecked power and underscoring how a lack of self-awareness can backfire in spectacular ways.

In one of these savage attacks, Albert&rsquo;s daughter and granddaughter are killed. His grandson, David, survives, but is seriously injured. Albert promises David justice, meaning the killers will be punished. During the haphazard investigations, which give the appearance of a cover-up, Albert is approached by a reporter suspecting deep corruption and conspiracy. He wants to help, but he fears placing his surviving family in peril. Based on real events, DON&rsquo;T SHOOT looks at both the pain these acts leave in their wake and the strength of survivors.

Some Ethiopian Jews have already fled to Israel, and those left behind are making secret plans to immigrate there. Mina, whose mother has already successfully arrived in the Holy Land, has stayed behind with her grandmother and brother, who are creating a delicate plot to escape their war-torn country. In a desperate attempt to save her Christian boyfriend, Eli, Mina puts her family&rsquo;s plans in jeopardy by refusing to leave him behind.

To keep a $6.5 billion seafood industry afloat with no line of employees willing to work on these boats for years at a time, Thai fishing companies kidnap and coerce men into slavery to man their ships. Beaten, starved, drugged, and tortured on these ships out at sea that rarely see land, some men manage to escape by jumping overboard and swimming to small, remote islands dotting the ocean. Although dangerous, the risk outweighs the boat&rsquo;s inevitable death sentence. GHOST FLEET joins Patima Tungpuchayakul, co-founder of the Labor Rights Promotion Network Foundation, and her dedicated team as they journey from Thailand to the distant islands of southern Indonesia to help these men finally return home. This shocking documentary exposes present-day slavery in its worst form and showcases the brave individuals refusing to leave their brothers stranded.

Mancha lives a carefree life, spending much of his free time drinking beer and hanging out on the streets of San Jose&acute; with his fellow messenger pals, who seem to goof off more than they work. His ambitious girlfriend, Clara, finds his lifestyle childish and is considering a move to Horse Island. She wants Mancha to come along, but bikes are prohibited there, and he&rsquo;s not quite ready for that level of commitment. He likes his life the way it is: simple and mostly free of responsibilities. But when unexpected circumstances leave him without a job or a motorcycle, Mancha must finally grow up and face the complexities of adulthood. Sprinkled with hilariously absurd moments, Villalobos&rsquo; off-beat comedy is an endearing and relatable account of one messenger&rsquo;s bumpy route to maturity.

Fifteen-year-old Magnea, an otherwise good student with a supportive, stable homelife, dabbles in temptation and finds herself enamored of older, mischievous Stella. Overshadowed by Stella&rsquo;s persuasive influence of crime, partying, and a growing drug addiction, their friendship and budding romance fall victim to how they&rsquo;ll get their next fix. Fast forward a few decades and the once-inseparable pair, though permanently linked, have followed very different paths. The out-of-sequence arrangement of LET ME FALL exposes snapshots of each woman&rsquo;s life from adolescence through adulthood. Slowly revealing the twisted details of how they&rsquo;ve led each other to the present day, the women&rsquo;s dark, gritty pasts will inevitably determine their uncertain futures.

Her father (Emile Hirsch) forbids it, telling her bad people want to kill them and they must stay hidden. One day Chloe defies dad, going outside for ice cream from a Mr. Snow-Cone truck. Mr. Snow-Cone (Bruce Dern) knows things about Chloe and shows her a world that may be just as insane as dad says. Billboards warn of &ldquo;abnormals&rdquo; and the news tells of children destroying Dallas. Does the strange Mr. Snow-Cone have the answers or is he a new danger? FREAKS is the cinematic equivalent of having a hand-mixer plunged into your brain and turned on high. This fiendishly crafted genre salad is an unsettling and pulse-pounding experience. Mixing dark political parable and apocalyptic sci-fi, it upends every expectation. Sometimes grim and violent, the film&rsquo;s most subversive maneuver is making these crazed events uncomfortably familiar while being genuinely touching. At its core, FREAKS is a story about what any family, &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or otherwise, will do to protect themselves and survive. , biography=null, locations=[USA,  CANADA], schedule=[Thursday April 04 2019 at 5:00 PM, Friday April 05 2019 at 11:30 PM, Sunday April 07 2019 at 11:25 AM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

With his lessons of nonviolent resistance movements and self-liberation, Grimm is the only man who seems to understand Ursula&ndash;and to make her feel special&hellip; but she&rsquo;s not the only one receiving special treatment. As Ursula slowly discovers that the polyamorous Grimm is seducing half the women in town, including her own mother, she hatches a plan for revenge.

Did insiders anticipate its arrival and, if so, why didn&rsquo;t they do more to stop it? Jennifer Deschamps explores these questions and more in her eye-opening documentary, INSIDE LEHMAN BROTHERS. The film profiles several former Lehman employees who discuss the corruption and lies that went on within the company. At the crux of the matter: sub-prime mortgages were sold to people who clearly couldn&rsquo;t afford them and, in some cases, records were intentionally fudged. These employees noticed the errors and warned their bosses, which could have prevented Lehman&rsquo;s bankruptcy and the notorious market crash. Instead of being rewarded, they became targets as it was made crystal clear their whistleblowing was unwelcome and they should keep quiet. Female employees tearfully recall when they were sexually harassed. The threats became so bad, they actually feared for their lives. This starkly honest film gives viewers a deeper look into an unnecessary crisis that personally affected many. It also offers crucial warning signs to avoid a repeat disaster. , biography=null, locations=[FRANCE,  CANADA], schedule=[Sunday March 31 2019 at 9:30 PM, Monday April 01 2019 at 4:15 PM, Tuesday April 02 2019 at 2:40 PM], shortPrograms=null, sidebars=null, premier=false, premierDescription=null]

Beyond his transformative role at the college and as a devout Catholic priest, Hesburgh was also an extremely powerful bi-partisan force in American politics. He advised several presidents and foreign leaders and, as a member of the Civil Rights Commission, was an architect of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He had friends on all sides of the religious and political aisles. Those friendships were often tested, though, as Hesburgh&rsquo;s allegiance wasn&rsquo;t to any one particular person or group, but to the greater good. On many occasions, he found himself at odds with his church and government. As the record shows, his strong moral compass always guided him to the right side of history.
